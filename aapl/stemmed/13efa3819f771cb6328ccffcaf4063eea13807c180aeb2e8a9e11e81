2015-11-10  11 10   pcs are go to be like truck they are still go to be around theyr still go to have a lot of valu but theyr onli go to be use by one out of x peopl steve job 2010nbspnbspthe ipad pro is come into the world with a lot of weight on it shoulder the specul and expect are run high is it a potenti laptop replac an enterpris play will it bring the consumpt heavi world of ipad and on top of it everyth els the onus is on it to prove that appl tablet line has leg in the face of slow sale and an incred long replac cyclethos are all valid question but im not sure ani of those thing matter as much as whether ipad pro telegraph someth about the way those who follow us will use comput what is a car or truck in the vein of job metaphor these day what kind of load do we need to carri and how has the way we carri them chang in five yearsth ipad pro is as good a time as ani tonbspbreak that downnbsp facebook ipad pro review  642 powerfirst let get some nut and bolt out of the way this new ipad is power and for various reason this is the first time i feel that it actual possibl to tell between this and the appl tv were see appl a seri chip get push realli realli hard for the first time and what this thing can do is pretti damn impress it push over 55 million pixel at all time but never stutter or lagsin order to save batteri life while push all of those pixel appl is pull a pretti crazi trick with the screen it refresh itnbsp30 time per second 30z when it static and your not touch it that half of the standard 60hz that youll see on other ipad everi 4 millisecond it poll for screen or touch activ if it see ani it transit back to 60hz and anim fluid it a clever trick and it pay off my batteri typic last around two day on wi fi with some sketch watch daniel of hous tiger with my daughter and do some type and brows in split screenappl isnt talk foundri by the way but as near as i can tell the a9x chip in the ipad pro is made by tsmc and onli tsmc whatev recent chatter there was about the iphon use chip from multipl manufactur wont be happen here there may be some other surpris onc we start to see teardown though becaus the cellular radio might be a differ manufactur than were use to see ill leav that for the suppli chain dissectionsbecaus app on the ipad and iphon are creat explicit for a limit set of hardwar and perform paramet it often difficult to tell how well theyr perform so for refer imovi on the ipad pro was abl to juggl not just two but five separ 4k video stream in real time edit it push watercolor and acryl simul out smooth enough in app like procreat and adob sketch to satisfi an artist that work in those medium day in and day out two processor intens app side by side no problem watch an episod of the flash in pip while edit enorm imag file sure done you get the picturefor the record though split screen made it appear on the 97 ipad it seem abund clear that it was design explicit for ipad pro have two ipad mini side by side run separ app is veri veri coolpencil artim a dabbler but have long sinc given up ani serious pencil work so to evalu the ipad pro and pencil as a creativ tool i brought in my dad thoma panzarino who is a work artist you can see his stuff here to noodl on it you can see his reaction in the video review but overal he was veri impress ive had him use a regular ipad and stylus combo befor and he wasnt wow i also had him take a surfac pro for a spin but the ipad pro and pencil just destroy it when it came to fluiditi and precisionth pencil probabl deserv it own review but appl did so much to the ipad pro to make it a welcom home for the stylus that it belong here the stylus is well built with some realli nice detail it weight proper just a tad heavier than a graphit pencil and well balanc it long enough to choke back on it to get some nice leverag for shade and the perfect thicknesssom of the feedback my dad gave was pretti on point it glossi so it slipperi a matt finish could make the pencil easier to hold and manipul if not that then a third parti sleev which add a grip posit or groov near the tip the tip is also veri smooth so it doesnt provid a lot of drag on the surfac of the screen normal you want to elimin drag as much as possibl but for an artist the way that a pencil pull across a page is part of the overal feel it wasnt a deal breaker but tip that offer slight more friction could be in order and onc again this could definit be serv by third parti how the pencil and ipad pro work togeth the pencil doe not work use the capacit sensor on the screen those are for finger onli which is how the ipad pro is abl to so confid reject accident palm or finger touch or to allow you to pop up a ruler with your finger while stroke on it with the pencil it a veri veri clever effect instead the pencil has electrod in it tip that are sens by a special modifi touch screen in the ipad pro appl isnt talk about what they did to it but it almost certain got an addit array of magnet sensor that can see the pencil includ altitud and azimuth readingsbluetooth pair the pencil but is onli use for pressur readingsnbspth pencil charg via a male lightn plug on the top that you can insert into the bottom of the ipad pro just a few second charg give you a half an hour and a few minut will quick charg it for even longer though it not realli been shown off the pencil doe come with a femal to femal lightn adapt that allow you to connect a regular charg cabl as well as a spare tipth cap also has a small metal ring which magnet center and snap it to the top of the pencil therebi avoid the stress and crack which could result from a pressur fit cap veri satisfi littl click on this cap i think mani an artist is about to develop a new tick the hole in the cap are for child safeti to allow air to pass through it if it is swallowedthat mean that it can see not onli how close a pencil is to the ipad pro but exact how far over it is lean allow it to provid a full gradat of tone and stroke shape between fine point and full on side shade or brush no fiddl with brush shape or size no dick around in palett you just use it natur without have to think about itno pencil doe not work on other ipad or the iphon some will be quick to cri foul this is a way for appl to forc peopl to upgrad the tip for instanc could have been made of materi that would trigger the capacit sensor like normal stylus do but appl motiv in this area are often misunderstood it not that theyr artifici limit the pencil address market it that standard stylus do not have the level of precis that pencil plus the ipad pros sensor array doesappl would rather the pencil not work at all than for it to deliv a sub standard experienceif youv use a stylus on an ipad you know how unpredict itnbspcan be the pencil is anyth but this simpl tenet is at the root of a lot of appl decis and it one that mani peopl choos to either ignor or attribut to pure mercenari motivationsnbspther is a thing that happen when your stroke is delay or not display how you feel it need to be it creat a hitch an irrit at the corner of your mind and make your stroke or brush hesit and timid yes some ipad artist have manag to train themselv to ignor it but this is about to blow their mind it as close to draw on paper as ani digit pen or tablet ive ever tri and my first wacom pad use a serial port so ive been around a bitwhich bring us to latenc the perceiv latenc on the ipad pro is sub 20 millisecond that a combin of whatev special array that appl is use to refresh the pencil posit 240 time per second 4x as fast as it poll for finger touch and softwar sauc which predict movement and normal path i cannot overst how import this advanc is the pencil track across the screen perfect follow your stroke no matter how aggress or quick it isnbsp keyboardth technolog behind the keyboard is veri cool theyv made a special connector for it that connect and hold realli well three dot one for ground one for power and one for data those are transmit via a layer of conduct cloth insid the cover which has been etch away to creat circuit that pass voltag from one end of the keyboard to anoth without ani wire it suuuuper slickbut the feel of the key are a bit mushi for my tast and isnt near as good on the rapid fli as a macbook keyboard the seal design is welcom for spill and splash and it better than okay it just not amaz i also had some issu with app switch use the cmdtab key combo but appar this is a known bug with some ipad pro keyboard and they shouldnt ship wide this wayit great to have a first parti keyboard that super low profil and doesnt requir extern power or charg i will be veri interest to see how appl iter on this first design what is itnev has the cri of it just a bigger appl thing been more applic than it has with ipad pro this is liter a bigger ipad but that approach to think about it is also reduct the microsoft surfac has blaze a sort of hybrid path for peopl that dont want to compromis have a laptop experi the ipad pro on the other hand is unapologet tableti the keyboard feel solid but it no substitut for a macbook the muti app experi on the other hand is far and away better than on ani compet system and the way that it enabl creativ to altern between the various mode is uniqu to this platformbi the way the a9x chip provid a perform curv that is so brutal effici that if this isnt an audit for a fulli a seri power lineup of mac i will eat my hatther are a lot of way to slice ipad pro but one of the biggest and hardest to quantifi is the way that it will end the debat about whether the tablet is a tool for creation onc and for alla for it be a replac for a desktop or laptop the technorati may hitch their pant and stomp around in a haze of jargon argu that microsoft couldnt figur it out so how will appl but out there in the real world peopl are use tablet and phone exclus my wife hasnt had a home person comput outsid of a phone and tablet in yearsnbspsh use my desktop andor laptop perhap onc or twice a month at most and usual onli becaus theyr handi sinc the ipad pro has been around the hous that gone down even further the screen real estat along with the precis of the pencil has made the pro more than enough comput for her need especi with the handi keyboardlook i get it there are complet valid argument for whi statement like tim cook end of the pc quot yesterday could be consid market hype or delus but there is a bigger issu i am absolut fed up with tech blogger and technic writer assum that all peopl use comput the way they do there is no longer just the truck of the desktop and laptop and the car of the phone there are gradat of tone in between and the ipad pro absolut 100 could be the central comput devic for a home mani day i run techcrunch from my phone on those day the tradit comput in my household lie dormant complet if you think this is an edg case you are blind yourself to the way the world has changedinstead ofnbspdwel on whethernbspan ipad or tablet cannbspdo exact whatnbspa laptop or desktop doe we need to ask ourselv what can it do differ or better not what it can duplic what it can enablewhen you talk about softwar eat the world it import to acknowledg where that softwar is end up it in app on mobil devic and the mobil web and it not just in home enterpris prefer app for myriad reason like secur eas of distribut and access control this is happen it just happen in the veri broad margin away from the societ and geograph center of techreplac cycl also a matter of obsess when it come to sale predict are still an unknown quantiti when it come to ipad no one know how long peopl will realli keep ipad not even appl phone replac cycl arent a model and neither are tradit comput model ipad have littl to no known malwar no bloatwar to make a machin run slower strict allow for util stand system resourc and known hardwar what happen when you have a capabl general consum comput devic with no move part and softwar that is design explicit for the maximum capabl of the devic and no more no one know it liter never happen beforeit go to take some time and experiment to figur this out despit my irrit at the way that the tablet space is analyz i am not will to declar the person comput non cupertino definit dead ill leav that to the bombast but there is a certain sorri norm core comput demograph that could veri well end up with an ipad pro as the enhanc compon to their smartphon which is their real comput somewher on the same level as other use case base devic like wearabl and an interconnect homeif you are a compani that is not explor that as appl is and as microsoft is then you should probabl look into a career in tech blog
