2015-10-19  10 19 london for the last few year i have realli like motorola moto rang of smartphon from the compani budget moto g to the flagship moto x the smartphon offer a great experi and some innov featur at veri competit price this year motorolaha decid to launch two version of it market lead moto x a coupl of month ago i test the less premium model the moto x play and realli like it so i was look forward to test out the moto x pure edit which cost upward of 400 and promis a larger screen and improv camera over last year model design the moto x pure edit or moto x style if you live outsid the us is not a bad phoneit just notveri interest or excitingmayb it was the whitegold review unit i receiv but pick up the new phone felt veri underwhelm and it consider size and heft meant it just didnt do anyth for me overal a bit nondescript the moto x pure edit cost 400 for the 16gb model david gilbert of cours if i were actuallybuy the phone myself i could have tweak the design consider use motorola uniqu moto maker servic i could choos between black and white front from 14 differ color textur plastic back and seven metal accent you can even engrav your phone at no extra cost howev it not just the pedestrian design of the phone that disappointsit is also big and bulki so it difficult to use one hand and it presenc in your pocket is alway notic though consid the size of the screen this is hard surpris screen it featur a larg 57 inch display with a high resolut of 2560 x 1440 pixel give it an incred high pixel densiti of 515 per inch it also veri bright offer over 700 unit of bright and while the move away from amol technolog to ip mean black are a littl less black overal this realli is a great display the moto x pure edit featur a bright high resolut screen david gilbert anoth new featur thefront face speaker on the moto x pure edit like the boomsound speaker on the htc one rang they do sound great but i wonder whether anyon will realli usethemasid from the annoy guy on the bus who want everyon to hear the film he is watch on his smartphon i dont recal ever realli need great speaker on my smartphon for voic call and the odd video imight be show to someon regular smartphon speaker are just fine in term of hardwar as you might expect the new moto x lie somewher between the flagship and the budget crowd it has a relat decent processor qualcomm snapdragon 808 pair with 3gb of ram which combin with the pure version of android on the deviceoff a pretti good experi i did find the phone stuttereda few time in the two week ive been use it which isnt someth i would have expect but overal the perform is veri good batteri life the base model come with just 16gb of storag with 32gb and 64gb model avail for an extra 50 and 100 respect there is howev a microsdcard slot mean you can upgrad to an extra128gb for arelativelysmal outlay the moto x pure edit can be custom by buyer use motorola moto maker system onlin david gilbert batteri life is one of the big sell point of the moto x pure edit accord to the compani own promot materi but i found it to be pretti poor i struggl to get a whole day out of a singl charg and while the turbocharg capabl 10 hour of use from a 15 minut charg is handi when you onli have a short time avail i would have prefer a longer overallbatteri life from the phone motorola also includ a coupl more innov featur on top ofandroid includ voic assist which allow you control the smartphon use a customiz greet the system work quit well but i found myself struggl to find a use for it beyond the initi setup process i work from home soshout at my phone wont draw ani strang look from co workersbut i simpli never use it the moto x pure edit also has motorola activ display featur which see the screen puls when you have notif the featur is meant to both save you time by let you glanc at notif rather than have to unlock the screen complet and save batteri live as the whole screen doesnt need to be power on the activ display featur on the moto x pure edit allow you see your notif without have to switch on the screen fulli david gilbert it work but i still found myself unlock the screen most of the time anyway to get some more inform but for those peopl get a lot more notif than me then this is a decent featur you canalso silenc incom call and alarm by swipe your hand over the screen which is a nice featur camera final on the uniqu featur front motorola continu to allow you launch the camera with a doubl twist of your wrist an action that work consist and while not as slick as a doubl tap of the home button as seen on the galaxi s6 edg it is still better than tap and swipingon the screen the camera on the moto x pure edit is a major improv over the previous version david gilbert speak of the camera the 21 megapixel sensor on the rear offer signific improv imag compar to the 2014 version of the moto x though it still fall some way short of the like of the galaxi note 5 lg g4 or iphon 6s plus in good light condit the moto x pure edit produc some excel imag but in low light the phone is still a long way behind the best smartphon cameraon the market it will captur 4k video for you and the front face 5 megapixel camera also come with it own led flash which make take nightclub selfiesso much easier here are some camera sampl moto x pure edit review camera sampl david gilbert moto x pure edit review camera sampl david gilbert moto x pure edit review camera sampl david gilbert conclus the moto x pure edit is a tough phone tocategor on one hand it 400 price tag suggest a pure mid rang smartphon but this is the flagship motorola smartphon for 2015 mean it should be compar to the galaxi s6 and iphon 6s at 400 this is 100 than the moto x play but certain doesnt feel it the larger higher resolut screen simpli wouldnt beenough to convinc me to switch while the lg built nexus 5x also offer pure android for 50 less than the moto x pure edit though with a smaller 52 inch screen the moto x pure edit has a lot go for it it has a big bright screen with a decent camera and lot of custom option it is also pretti bulki with uninspir design and poor batteri life in a smartphon market so crowdedthes few issu can be a big problem key featur
