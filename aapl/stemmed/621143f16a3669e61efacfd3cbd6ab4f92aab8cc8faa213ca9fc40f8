2015-11-12  11 12 appl iphon 6s imag sourc appl in 2014 appl nasdaqaapl broke with tradit and launch not one but two flagship mobil devic iphon 6 and iphon 6 plus the iphon 6 plus was essenti a larger version of the iphon 6 but with a few enhanc name a higher resolut display and the inclus of optic imag stabil for still imag with this year iphon 6s6s plus the differ between the two devic remain the same except this year the iphon 6s plus gain support for optic imag stabil with video as well it would seem though accord to a report from well known kgi secur analyst ming chi kuo that next year iphon 7 plus will includ more system memori than the iphon 7 let take a closer look at what this might impli for the next generat iphon some memori basic accord to kuo the ad memori in the iphon 7 plus over the iphon 7 will be includ for perform reason to understand how ad memori can lead to better perform it import to understand the role of main memori in a comput system such as the iphon whenev an applic run the oper system load that applic into memori so that the main processor can access the data and instruct associ with that program as quick as possibl in fact in io if there is not enough room for the current run applic in main memori the oper system will actual shut down other app in order to make room for the current run app in main memori as long as the applic that a user is run can fit into current avail memori the user experi should be good whi would a larger screen phone need more memori right now there isnt much to differenti the larger iphon from the smaller one asid from the minor camera differ and the display resolut howev i suspect that in a bid to tri to enrich it product mixiphon averag sell price appl will continu to add hardwaresoftwar featur to differenti it larger iphon from the smaller one one fair obvious thing that appl could introduc is split screen multitask in it larger iphon begin with the iphon 7 plus a featur similar to what is current avail on the ipad air 2 and the upcom ipad pro sinc such a featur should allow two potenti resourc hungri applic to run in tandem it could make sens to increas the amount of memori includ in the devic could futur plus model get improv applic processor too although kuo say that both the iphon 7 and 7 plus will use appl upcom a10 processor i do think that at some point down the line appl might benefit from develop a more power applic processor specif for the plus iphon for exampl sinc the larger iphon are general in thicker chassi with greater volum an applic processor specif tailor for the larger phone could be allow to dissip more heat the larger phone also have substanti larger batteri which could also allow appl to deliv more perform at the same batteri life i dont think such an applic processor would have to be vast differ from a design perspect the differ between an iphon plus bound a seri processor and a vanilla iphon bound a seri processor could simpli be one of oper frequenc on both the cpu and the graphic block if appl want to get realli fanci though it could increas the number of gpu core to better support the higher resolut display found on the plus model that said i dont think the challeng here is one of actual build the custom chip appl can certain afford to hire whatev talent that it need in order to support the develop of such chip rather i suspect that the difficulti associ with have two differ phone chip design would stem from have to manag the inventori of the two differ chip model appl probabl has enough data to be abl to reason approxim the demand mix between the regular size iphon and the plus model but there no doubt that such a move would introduc addit complex that the compani just doesnt feel the need to deal with 3 compani pois to explod when cabl die cabl is die and there are 3 stock that are pois to explod when this falter 22 trillion industri final bite the dust just like newspap publish telephon util stockbrok record compani bookstor travel agenc and big box retail did when the internet swept away their busi model and when cabl falter you dont want to miss out on these 3 compani that are posit to benefit click herefor their name hint theyr not the one youd think ashraf eassa has no posit in ani stock mention the motley fool own share of and recommend appl tri ani of our foolish newslett servic free for 30 day we fool may not all hold the same opinion but we all believ that consid a divers rang of insight make us better investor the motley fool has a disclosur polici
