2015-11-13  11 13 appl latest iphon the iphon 6s in a new rose gold finish imag credit appl in a recent research note from cowen timothi arcuri via barron the analyst say appl nasdaqaapli brew evid of three core for the appl a10 processor that will power next year iphon 7 he note that such a move which would mean an increas die size would lead to increas demand for wafer and ultim for semiconductor equip vendor next year although i concur with arcuri that the a10 will almost certain see die size growth relat to this year a9 and the a10x may see growth relat to the a9x i dont think appl will add an addit cpu core here whi more core is general not the best way to go the vast major of mobil applic will benefit from improv per core perform than from the addit of more core mani if not most mobil applic dont realli know what to do with more than one or mayb two cpu core but everi applic can benefit from a core that can process a singl applic thread at a faster clip there is onli so much power that a mobil cpu will be allow to consum for an extend period of time with a greater number of core in the chip the less power each core can be allow to consum when all of those core are lit up lest batteri life or thermal suffer of cours mani modern processor tri to be smart about how power is alloc between the various core in a workload where all of the core are lit up the power may be distribut among the core differ than it would be in a workload that realli onli peg one or two core howev if the cpu design in this case appl notic the vast major of workload benefit from alloc that fix power budget to just one or two core rather than across three four or even more then it probabl make sens to includ just two core on the die whi arent more core better one question the reader might have is if the cpu can just dynam alloc power as need to the various core whi not includ more although there are mani good technic reason for this there is an even more compel econom reason cost even a rich and power compani like appl is subject to econom constraint in order for appl to be abl to hit it desir per unit profit it need to keep the manufactur cost of it compon in check although the cost of ani one compon that goe into a devic like the iphon is probabl not terribl high go over budget across mani compon could veri well be margin death by a thousand cut so we need to work under the assumpt that for each generat appl has a fix amount of silicon real estat to work with appl design have the luxuri of have more silicon real estat to work with than most other chip design given the veri high price the compani command for it iphon but there are limit at ani rate appl cpu core tend to be veri power and relat to core from other vendor quit larg accord to a report written by paul boldt the dual core cpu complex insid of the a9 take up a whop 13 squar millimet or around 14 of the total a9 chip area ad anoth core would actual add a nontrivi amount of area which would mean appl would need to either incur increas product cost or it would have to skimp on other area to keep the die sizecost in check given the minim benefit associ with ad a third core that previous die area is better spent beef up other section of the chip such as the graphic block graphic is a special kind of workload in which more core assum the same type of core is better for perform appl also gave us a pretti huge hint with the a9x what interest is that even though last year a8x chip found insid the ipad air 2 employ a tripl core cpu design the a9x chip found insid of the ipad pro this year goe back to a dual core design each core in the a9x is much faster than the core found in the a8x so much so that the a9x actual deliv better multicor perform than the a8x in light of the fact that appl chose to use two higher speed version of the core found in the a9 for the a9x which goe into a veri larg tablet that can handl much more heat from the chip than the thin and small iphon can whi would appl sudden add a third core to the iphon 7 bound a10 it doesnt make ani sens i believ that with the a10 appl will make tweak to the cpu core themselv to deliv more oomph per clock and thank to a 16 nanomet process that more matur deliv higher clock to boot it will howev most like be a dual core chip not a tripl core one 3 compani pois to explod when cabl die cabl is die and there are 3
