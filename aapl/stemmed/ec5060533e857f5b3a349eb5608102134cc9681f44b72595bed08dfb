as an experi ipad pro push boundari as a practic product it leav a lot to be desir and it hard to make a case for it against microsoft nasdaqmsft surfac pro line or it new surfac book laptoptablet hybrid it not that the big high end ipad isnt an impress tablet it just that it not a laptop replac and in some way it size make it impract as a tablet ipad pro imag sourc author that make ipad pro a laptoptablet hybrid that in a lot of normal situat replac neither devic it also in no way a desktop replac even though ceo tim cook suggest to recod that it could be yes the ipad pro is a replac for a notebook or a desktop for mani mani peopl they will start use it and conclud they no longer need to use anyth els other than their phone cook said that would be true for someon who never fli on a plane use his laptop on his lap or has a desktop monitor bigger than 129 inch it a realli nice tabletwhil it hard to see exact who would use the ipad pro over a surfac pro a surfac book or even appl own macbook it still a pretti impress tablet the retina screen offer stun detail and the extra three plus inch of screen compar to an ipad is especi use in laptop mode the problem is that even though it light for it size 157 pound and thinner than other ipad 699 millimet pretti similar to an iphon 6 and reach those number like requir mani feat of engin ipad pro is still awkward when use as a tablet imagin spend an hour read a book on it or watch a movi with no place to put it down if you use a tablet sole on a desk or a tabl then this is the best one ever creat but if like most peopl you use a tablet in bed on the train and in other mobil situat the ipad pro is just too much devic the keyboard is a failon of the biggest success of microsoft surfac line is it innov keyboard that also serv as a cover for the devic while it not quit as good as a top tier laptop the surfac type cover offer a full keyboard with a decent trackpad and all the key you would expect to find that make surfac especi the pro 3 and 4 decent laptop replac this is help by the kickstand in the back of the pro surfac devic that allow it to be prop up in a varieti of angl the ipad pro smart keyboard imag sourc author it still a bit hard to use on your lap but it vast better than appl smart keyboard which is a fold cover that miss the row of function key that top the macbook keyboard and doe not have a trackpad it also a floppi design that make it use onli a hard surfac like a desk or tabl the key action itself is ok in line with microsoft or at least close but if you have to work on a desk anyway whi pay 169 for that when a top of the line bluetooth enabl appl magic keyboard cost just 99 and the magic mous 2 goe for 79 yes that 10 more but you get a mous and much better keyboard realist less than 50 could buy you a decent bluetooth keyboard and mous combo that would be an improv over the smart keyboard of cours you would still need a kickstand of some sort becaus unlik surfac ipad pro doe not have one built in a stylus is a littl sillyin addit to the smart keyboard appl is also sell a stylus the appl pencil for 99 it not avail yet it ship in earli decemb and i have not test it but id argu that at best a stylus is for a nich audienc the author get a littl creativ with his finger on ipad pro imag sourc author appl pencil like the similar peripher microsoft offer is almost certain impress for what it is but both compani appear to have over estim just how often our finger arent more than enough when use a touchscreen some artist and design may appreci appl pencil as might some colleg kid who want to take note by hand but asid from those group a stylus is just not someth a mass audienc is ani more interest in now than it was when appl offer one with the newton in 1993 innov without an audienceappl has done some pretti impress thing with the ipad pro and built a tablet with fair stun spec that would be more impress if it lower end tablet werent alreadi fair great and if ipad pro fill ani sort of need it too big to be a use tablet too small to be a desktop replac and as a laptop well it isnt one ipad pro is fun to play with and perhap it can find a nich audienc with artist or creativ type but it just not a practic replac for a tablet a laptop or a desktop the next billion dollar isecret the world biggest tech compani forgot to show you someth at it recent event
