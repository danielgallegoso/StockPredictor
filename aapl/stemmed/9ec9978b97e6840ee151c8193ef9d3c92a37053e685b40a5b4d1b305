2015-11-13  11 13 oneplus is a compani that say it care about the product it build and want to creat cultur signific devic it has step back from plan to expand into thewear and speaker market to focus entir on it smartphon effort and if the oneplus x is anyth to go by that was a veri smart decis the oneplus x avail in the us start nov 19is a huge impress smartphon and that is even befor you consid it cost just 249 i like the compani bigger and more expens oneplus 2 which it launch just a coupl of month ago but i like the x a whole lot more minimalist the phone is pretti much the definit of the black slab of glass and metal mani cite as be the problem with the copycat smartphon industri today but what oneplus has done is focus on the detail so that the final product is beauti and a pleasur to use the oneplus x has a minimalist design but it get the detail right david gilbert the main issu i had with the design is that the oneplus x is so uniform and symmetr i sometim had difficulti figur our which side was which even after pick it up the onli thingto break the straight line and flat surfac is the white oneplus logo on the back have been use to use much bigger phone the best thing about the oneplus x was it size it has a 5 inch screen hous in an incred slim 69 mm and lightweight 138gram bodi which mean i didnt have to forc it to fit into my pocket and it wasnt alway poke mein the hip when i bent overlik the bigger iphon or galaxi note sharp and bright unlik all other phone at this price point the oneplus x is all metal and glass with the metal frame featur micro groovesto help prevent the phone from slip out of your hand while this doe work there is also a slight sharp edg to the phone that make swipe across the slight rais screen not as great as it could be the oneplus x speaker grill on the bottom edg is reminisc of the iphon speaker grill david gilbert speak of the screen it is a full hd amol panel which is both bright and sharp and unlik some amol panel we have seen from samsung in the past the color here are not oversatur black are also deeper and for a 249 phone this is an excel smartphonescreen obvious at this price point there had to be some compromis so dont expect a fingerprint sensor nfc or the fastest chipset on the market inde oneplus is use an 18 month old snapdragon 801 chipfrom qualcomm that i worri would not be abl to handl some task have use the phone for over a week now i cant say the perform is flawless but some earli niggl have been most address with a softwar updat from oneplus while there were some stutter when switch app and navig the interfac i found more power intens task like stream video and play game to work perfect and the phone also never got notic warm which i was worri about givenit slim profil and metal frame the older chipset is also help by a beefi 3gb of ram batteri life and camera in term of batteri life the phone lightweight 2525mah batteri doe well to just about get through a full day use and consid this is all you can expect from the vast major of phone these day that not a bad effort the oneplus x is slim and lightweight and easili slip into your pocket david gilbert typic where flagship smartphon shine is with their camera with the like of the samsung galaxi note 5 lg g4 and iphon 6s all lead the pack in 2015 oneplus cannot match these devic but what it doe offer is a decent 13 megapixel sensor and the promis of a veri fast autofocus system while the camera is respons it is still behind the best in classthough it will produc some realli great imag in the right condit low light perform is again one of the area where the oneplus x cant match the big gun and just like the oneplus 2 the time it take for the phone to process the imag after you hit the shutter button is just too long and mean you could miss out on the shot you are look for the camera app just like the minimalist design of the phone is strip back and barebon but that also mean it is pretti easi to use and you are not facedwith a million option to tweak befor take your shot video is avail in 1080p as well as slow mo and time laps option the front face camera featur an 8 mpsensor and produc some great detail imag along with the now obligatori beauti mode the oneplus x camera may not match the best on the market but it can still do a job david gilbert on the softwar side of thing the oneplus x come with the compani own version of android call oxygenosbut unlik some android skinsit ispretti light and add some genuin use featur most notabl the abil to draw a letter on the lock screen to automat launch certain app such as an o to open the camera and a v to turn the flashlighton and off you can also control music playback in this way final the oneplus x also add an fm radio app which may seem like a throwback but could save a lot of data charg especi when roam there is so much to like about the oneplus x even asid from the price it is a strip back minimalist smartphon that is small slim and lightweight in a world where we are surround by ever bigger phablet it is great to use a phone that has such a small footprintth premium build qualiti and materi speak to the compani focus on craftsmanship and you are not go to get anyth like this at this price from ani other manufactur competit regard that competit there are an increas number of manufactur look for a piec of this price bracket motorola flank the oneplus x with the 180 moto g which offer a lower resolut screen and the moto x style which deliv a bigger higher resolut screen but cost 400 htcs desir 626 again featur a lower resolut screen for 239 fellow chines brand alcatel onetouch idol offer similar spec for the same pricebut cant match the oneplus x in qualiti the biggest challeng to the oneplus x could of cours come from the compani itself with the 329 oneplus 2 and it bigger screen fingerprint sensor faster processor and the option of more built in storag but it is also more expens and consider bulkier the us smartphon market is domin by mobil network with more than 90 percent of smartphon sold through att verizon and the like but that is slowli chang a lot of peopl no longer want to be tie to long term contract but buy an iphon from appl or galaxi s6 from samsung is go to set you back a lot of money that is where the oneplus x come in it may not be abl to match the market leader in all respect but for 249 this is a lot of phone
