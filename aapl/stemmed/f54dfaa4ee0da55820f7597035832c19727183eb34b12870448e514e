2015-10-16  10 16 london i need your cloth boot and your motorcycl when the t 1000 utter this iconiclin in termin 2 not mani peopl would have predict that just over a decad latera skynet likeartifici intellig systemwould be help them pick out their next pair of shoe but that is just what happen today with one of the world most power ai network team up with shoescom to help you pick the perfect pair of pump sentient technologiesha creat what it call theworld biggest artifici intellig networkand is usingit to solv some of the world biggest problem such asimprov financi marketsand helpingidentifysymptom of diseas faster but right now it take on a veri thorni problem find the right shoe sentient which is base in san francisco and is the world most fund ai companyi run by antoin blondeau who help develop the system that would becom appl siri person assist the compani has built an ai network comprising2 million cpus and 5000 graphic card distribut in 4000 locat around the world that a massiv scalebut itsjust the begin saysblondeauthi is first base this is year onein the decad one of ai speak at the wire 2015 confer in london on friday blondeau reveal his compani latest collaborationwith shoescom to make shop for footwear more intuitivemak onlin shoe shop better may not seem signific but blondeau told intern busi timesit just one exampl of what this technolog can do by ad visual percept to the comput power it has alreadi creat by make more inform decis chanc are you will make better decis at this compani we tri to solv real problem  we tri to appli technolog towhat will make a differ chang peopl live the ai assist which will roll out on shoescom in the next few week will dynam curat the content of the store depend on yourshop preferencesinst present youwith an ever chang catalogof shoe as youtap on the one youlik we alway say a pictur is worth a thousand word or you know it when you see itthat is what we are do here blondeau say the system doesnt reli on tag type or submit imag of what you are look forbut itdo providefrict free access to thing you want but cannot googl eureka moment after work with blondeau on the program that would becom siribabak hodjat co founder of sentientwa look for a new challeng a few year ago he had his eureka moment whilein the shower sudden it came to me veri veri clear if a speci like human can network intellig would it be possibl for us to network ai blondeaus goal was to build an infinit scalabl system that would take on huge problem world problemsth start point for blondeaus ambiti plan was darwin theori of evolut which had been port into softwar in the second half of the last centuri by john holland creat a new ai disciplin call evolutionari intellig this led to one of holland student john koza breed so call autonom softwar agentsthat were abl to solv enorm complex problem power by a comput cluster with 1000 cpus call the invent machinethi machin was abl to help reinvent logic circuit and make factori work more effici blondeau and hodjat ask themselvescan we take that bodi of work and do better advanc the scienc and take it to the next level the next level the problem blondeau and hodjat set out to address was the financi market to solv the extrem dynam and complex system thati extraordinarili difficult to surviv in the pairneed to scale the system so that it could run on a million cpus after year of work design the system to be abl to scale it to the size they need sentient technolog bred it first ai trader with the system now creat trillion of trader they are born they compet they surviv they die they thrive they reproduc they mutat they becom a speci that eventu begin to domin it environ blondeau said the next challeng they turn their attent to was healthcar and in particular the intens care unit of hospit where lot of data is collect but not util what the compani want to build was anai nurs that is alway on the clock alway on the lookout for youmonitor your vital at ani given timepreempt problem the scale of sentient technolog artifici intellig network is greater than anyth seen befor david gilbertintern busi time in partnership with the massachusett institut of technolog sentient technolog built a system that would specif address the problem of the blood diseas sepsissepsi is thesingl biggest problem icushav to deal with affect 1 million peopl each year in the us with a mortal rate between 28 and 50 percent depend on the year you look at that higherthan prostat cancer breast cancer and aid combin add to this the fact that sepsi cost icus 20 billion everi year and it is clear a problem that need to be address work with st michael hospit in toronto sentient learn that if doctor were given a 30 minut warn that sepsi was come they would be abl to treat the problem after a year of collectingarteri blood pressuredata beatbybeat from 6000 patient they set their ai nurs to work itwa abl to predict the onset of sepsi with over 91 percentaccuraci we are use artifici evolut to solv problem brought about by our own biolog evolut the good thing about artifici evolut is that it doesnt take billion of year to solv problem we can solv it in day week month blondeau said stealth mode sentient has rais 143 million to datefrom five investor accord to crunchbas and along with uk companydeepmind technolog which was purchas by googl in 2014 it is lead the ai push globallyblondeau say there aretheoret limit to sentient network but it is not all about size with percept visual audio emot a vital aspect of evolv ai to the next level deepmind a compani acquir by googl use deep learn techniqu to program comput to learn from visual data much like the human brain deepmindcom last year sentient came out of what blondeau call stealth mode in order to replic the successdeepmind has had but say that hire the right peopl in the bay area is tough due tocompetit from the like offacebook and googl the compani howev has manag to doubl it workforc to 100 peopl in the past 12 month and has lost none of it employe to competitor in that time blondeaubelievesw are at the veri begin of the ai revolut andthat from the starteth play an import role in it develop to that end sentient along with it peer includ deepmindsign a pledgeearli this year to use the technolog onli for good artifici intellig as depict in the termin movi star arnold schwarzenegg may be get closer to realiti thank to work be done by sentient technolog reuter while elon musk and stephen hawk may make headlin with their warn of evil artifici intellig blondeau say we are nowher near thatpoint i do not believ for one second that what we are do or what other are do in the industri is danger we are not there yet it will take a long time for this to becom this out of control scienc fiction stuff but it is never too earli to start think about this and put the right framework in place so skynet and the termin may still be a long way off but crucial the world of onlin shoe shop may never be the same again
