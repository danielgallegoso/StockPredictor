devic on the market today oneplus is a chines startup that should be bare a blip inth smartphon world the companysfirst smartphon sold 15 million unit a drop in the bucket when you consid that over350 million smartphon ship in the last quarter alon oneplus would seem to merit littl attent but this compani doe thing a littl differ by sell smartphon through an innov and high frustrat invit systemofferinglow price and theboldclaim it make about it devic oneplus is a compani which offer someth a littl bitunusu in the smartphon world and has develop a fanat fan base just a coupl of month after it launch it 2016 flagship killer the oneplus 2 the compani is back with an even cheaper smartphon that promis to combin sleek premiumdesign with a 249 price tag andit could be just about the best valu on the market peopl want smaller phone at the launch of the new oneplus smartphon in london co founder carl pei said one of the compani strength is that it listen to it custom and communic with them direct recent a lot of this communicationinvolv easingang about delay shipment of the oneplus 2 and problem with the invit system but pei say the compani also learnedthat custom want smallerdevic the oneplus x is describ by the compani as a work of art and it is hard to argu with them david gilbert and so we get the oneplus x aslimsleek smartphon with a 5 inch screen that ultra thin 69mm and light 138g a phone made withpremium materi like metal and glass someth most budget smartphon simpli dont offer it is incred compact for a 5 inch smartphon with it footprint onli slight larger than the 47 inch iphon 6s peipushedth oneplus x design veri strong call it a work of art the compani launch two version the standard onyxedit which featur a combin of glass and metal and an exclus ceram version that take 25 day to make and will be avail inlimit quantiti of10000 design whi a ceram phone veri few compani would make onepei conced becaus of the product yield rate onli one in five end up be usabl but in this caseth strategi is to buildbrand awar the world has beenslowli lose interest in craftsmanship say pei but the oneplus x bring back what happen when you bring back some of that pride in the creation of a product the all metal and glass construct of the oneplus is a world away from most budget smartphon david gilbert pei assert the extra time and money spent to creat the ceram version was worth the end result but in the time i had with the two version i found it difficult to see a clear differ and at time struggl to tell one from the other that said the black glass onyx model is better than ani smartphon i have use at this price point and better thanmani that cost more itfeatur a metal frame like the one on the iphon 4 but with 17 micro groov etch into it all the way around which make it easier to holdth screen is slight curv and rais away from the edgemak swipingeasi the look and feel is minim at it best with the onli thing break the pure black line be the low key oneplus logo on the rearnot that it perfectth rear cover is glass so it pick up fingerprint veri quick but im will to overlook this slight negat given the overal design and build qualiti on display here screen oneplus decid to go with amol technolog with the oneplus x over the ip tech in it previous two smartphon while amol allow for featur like monochrom notif on the lock screen to save batteri life there are some issu with oversatur and while black are realli black color reproduct is not quiteso natur compar to the oneplus 2 right the oneplus x is a compact and slim smartphon david gilbert the 5 inch screen has full hd resolut the same as the 55 inch screen on the oneplus 2 that add up toa higher pixel resolut 441ppi vs 400ppiwhich suggeststh screeni much sharper though the differ is not immedi obvious overal the screen is great and consid that most phone in this price bracket offer 720p display rather than 1080p display this is certain a cut abov most of it competit the ambient display featur whichlet youactiv the screen to see notif with the wave of a hand is also a nice addit perform andbatteri life so far it all sound too good tobe true but one major concern is the one plus xs useof thedatedsnapdragon 801 chipset from qualcomm this was releas over 18 month ago but the compani say it still offer better result than qualcomm latest mid rang offer to offset the older chipset the oneplus x doe come witha hefti 3gb of ram to boost perform and in the time i use the phone i found no problem with respons time or navig the interfaceit will take more test to realli see how well it handl more intens task like stream video and 3d game the perform is like help by the use of the compani own oper system call oxygen itsa relat light skin version of android offer lot of custom option oneplus has even ad a throwback to older devic with the abil to listen to fm radio on the new phone without have to use up data particular handi when travel one of the big question to be answer is if the camera on the oneplus x can live up to claim david gilbert the phone featur a dual sim card setup that can also be use as a microsd card slot to expand the limit 16gb storag byup to anoth 128gb this is vital consid there are no higher storag optionsth phone come with a relat small 2525mah batteri which oneplus claim will give you all day batteri life but this again will need to be test fulli befor i would givea final verdict camera therear camera on theoneplus x which sit flush with theback cover come with a 13 megapixel sensor and the compani claim it phase detectionauto focus system allow usersto focus in under 02 second in the brief test i carri out at the launch the camera did seem veri respons though it struggl to produc sharp clearimag in the dim surround of the central london tower where the phone debut the front face camera has an impress 8 megapixel sensor on the front and with the few selfi i could manag to take it produc veri decent resultsth oneplus x also has the option to quick launch the camera app by scribe a c on thedisplay even from the lock screen valu beyond the design camera batteryand processor a key sell point for ani smartphon in this section of the marketi price the oneplus xs strong suitfor 249 you get a premium feel phone with a good screen and camera at a fraction of what youd pay for a flagship model the phone doe featur a date processor and limit storag but the addit of a microsd card offset the latter the one design flaw with the oneplus x is unavoid on a glass back devic fingerprint david gilbert look at the ever increas competit in this space motorola flank the oneplus x with the 180 moto g which offer a lower resolut screen and the moto x style whichdeliv a bigger higher resolut screen but cost 400 htcs desir 626 again featur a lower resolut screen for 239 fellow chines brand alcatel onetouch idol offer similar spec for the same price but it cant match the oneplus x in qualiti the biggest challeng to the oneplusx could of cours come from the compani itself with the 329 oneplus 2and itsbigg screen fingerprint sensor faster processor and the option of more built instorag but it is also more expens and consider bulkier avail the oneplus x onyx is avail for preorder in europ start nov 5th with the ceram version on presal start nov 24th us date have yet to be
