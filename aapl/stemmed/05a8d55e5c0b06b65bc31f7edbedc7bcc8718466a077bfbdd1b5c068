2015-10-22  10 22 london therano and 23andm promis so much these well fund startup game chang servic blood test avail at your local walgreen and health risk indic given from a sampl of your saliva seem to usher inth era of person and instant healthcar a few year agobut with therano nowpress paus on the develop of it proprietari technolog and 23andm continu to fight the us food and drug administr to let it provid custom with health risk inform the bright futur they herald seem to be on hold until you hear about all the other compani most unknown offeringradicalchang inth way the healthcar system work theyar use techniqu like 3d bio print artifici intellig aiand smart drug to predict diseas befor they developtailor treatment to individu rather than the general populationand theoret at least provid the tool that could let us live forev microsoft allow everi famili in the world to particip in person comput appl allow the world to communic in veri differ and dynam way my hope and my humbl dream is to allow everybodi to particip in their own health saidniven narain the co founder presid and chief technolog offic at berg a boston base compani use ai to creat smart tailor treatment that work for specif patient in half the time it tradit take and at a fraction of the cost berg is just one of a group of compani at the forefront of a revolut promis to fix what narain call a complet broken system and that revolut is alreadi happen the shift is not about to come or the paradigm is not about to changeit has chang we are in the middl of it narain told intern busi time in london after he spoke at the wire 2015 confer one size fit all approach everyon has seen theheadlin proclaim revolutionari drugbreakthrough andposit result from life save drug trial onli for that promis to evapor or for the drug to take year to come to market inde the healthcar startup landscap is litter with big bet and correspond failur the next wave of health care technolog let peopl track mani various aspect of their health on their own reuter the problemat the heart of the healthcar industri is the way drug are develop it cantak up to 15 year for a drug to reach consum and that process can cost25 billion in research and develop the current one size fit all approach to drug develop mean that for everi 100 drug candid that reach the first stage clinic trial onli one make it into the hand of patient last year pharmaceut companiessp 50 billion on research and developmentbut the fda approv only40 new drugsin ani other industri in the world we would all be fire narain said dryli big pharma is face animpend patent cliff which narain say will see 60 percent of revenu disappear by 2017 as patent on the biggest earn drug run out with biotech stock fall sharpli in recent month compani like astrazeneca pfizer roch novarti and other are look over their shoulder at the compani look to take their place this is the futur his compani bring togeth ai big data and precis medicin to comb through vast trove of inform about specif patient to find out which treatment work best for themthi approach has allow them creat a drug for pancreat cancer current in test whichcan identifyreactiv mitochondria in die cell prevent them from becom cancer this approach is to take data from the patient tissu use proprietari algorithm to creat a map of what is caus the diseas and point research in the direct of a specif treatment those identifi with metastat pancreat cancer havean averag life expect of just six month and it is one of the toughest version of the perniciousdiseas to treat with narain say that 90 percent of patient fail the first line of therapi berg approach is onli made possibl through the use of ai and narain believ this is the way all drug will soon be develop if you are develop drug that are biolog base and you have an artifici platform to help match your patient to drug this is the futur narain say and the system work the compani has reduc the time it take to discov a viabl drug candid which typic take between three and five year at a cost of 150 million to less than 12 month and while narain wouldnt reveal the exact cost he did tell ibt the cost was less than half what is normal spent on this process shorten the time it take to identifi ideal candid for drug trial is just the first hurdl the industri need to overcom print human tissu withdrug need to go through a seri of clinic trial befor get fda approvalon of the main stick point is the switch from test on anim to human trial with up to 50 percent of drug fail to make it past this pointorganovo a 3d bio print compani say it can make a big differ herebi print human tissu and use that as an addit checkpoint in the drug develop process between anim and human trial an illustr of a 3d bio printer abl to print human tissu technolog that still mani year away if it happen at all christoph barnattexplainingthefuturecom what work for the anim often doesnt work for the human said founder and chief scientif offic gabor forgac so befor we go to the human organ whi dont we tri someth on the level of a print tissu and eventu we will be abl to elimin anim trial organovo has spark a lot of hype and in septemb it saw it share rise more than 55 percent befor settl back down again the reason for the roller coaster stock price is down to the fact that while the potenti impact of organovo technolog is huge it is far from guarante some have jump year ahead by predict the technolog will lead to the 3d print of organ but forgac is quick to dampen such enthusiasm even if this is possibl it is go to take a long time so dont smoke too much dont drink too much becaus we are not yet there with cut edg technolog like this there is alway the chanc that the promis is never realiz forgac is eager to highlightwhat is possibl today which is the abil to bio print small liver which are architectur and function correct and pharmaceut compani are use those tissu alreadi for toxic test allow for patient specif test by use the patient own cell which will eventu help the developmentpati tailor drug the near futur accord to forgac will seeth creation of model organ by put togeth those engin tissu liver kidney etc which will allow compani like bergtest and develop drug on this artifici system a potenti even more critic use for this technolog would be asastop gap in the organ donat process use small 3 d print organstokeeptermin patientsal until a donor is found in the us alon in 2014 over 120000 peopl were on the organ donor wait list with less than 25000 of those receiv the organ they need to stay aliv which highlight just how import organovo technolog could be your ai nurs organovo technolog may be use to limit the damag of diseas but anoth technolog compani isalreadi use it cut edg techniqu to prevent the diseas ever developingsenti technolog the world mostwel fund aicompani is use the world most power ai network to creat anew type of nurs one which predict when a patient might develop a diseas with incred accuracyin the word of sentient founder antoin blondeau it is developinga nurs that is alway on the clock alway on the lookout for you monitor your vital at ani given time preempt problem sentient technolog co founder antoin blondeau say we are just at the veri begin of the artifici intellig revolut david gilbertintern busi time to highlight the potenti of this technolog sentient partner with the massachusett institut of technolog to build a system that would specif address the problem of the blood diseas sepsi sepsi is the singl biggest problem intens care unit icus have to deal with affect 1 million peopl each year in the us alon with a mortal rate between 28 and 50 percent that higher than prostat cancer breast cancer and aid combin add to this the fact that sepsi cost icus 20 billion everi year and it is clear a problem that need to be address work with st michael hospit in toronto sentient learn that if doctor were given a 30 minut warn that sepsi was come they would be abl to treat the problem after a year of collect arteri blood pressur data beat by beat from 6000 patient they set their ai nurs to work it was abl to predict the onset of sepsi with over 91 percent accuraci we are use artifici evolut to solv problem brought about by our own biolog evolut the good thing about artifici evolut is that it doesnt take billion of year to solv problem we can solv it in day week month blond said reach the limit of our abil on wednesday 23andm was grant a licens by the fda to begin offer custom in the us health data again the compani founder ann wojcicki told ibt ahead of the fdas decis that part of the reason it got shut down in the first place was naiveti i think what happen is that we reach the limit of our abil and we didnt have a veri experienc team on the regulatori side but we now have an incred experienc team and i think we understand much better now all the thing we did not know while 23andm main attract for the user is the abil to get genet inform about their ancestor as well as their potenti risk of develop a certain diseas the big opportun for the compani is in the data which is it collect wojcicki say the compani has the world biggest pool of genet inform with over 80 percent of it userbas which recent pass the one million mark agre to that data be use for drug develop while 23andm is carri out some of the research itselfit is also generat revenu from compani likepf and genentech who pay for access to the data this is the new realiti of the pharmaceut industri where the big giant of the industri know they need to address the brokensystem of drug develop and look at what compani like berg are do emot narain say he know compani like roch novarti andastrazeneca are all make move in the ai area alreadi and hire non tradit employe like mathematicianswith ai such a hot topic in a wide varieti of industri at the moment the big problem for compani will be hire the right peopl witheveryon hire two or three year befor they finish their degre accord to narain mean there is unlik to be a stabl job market in theai field for five to seven year big pharma compani like pfizer are now look over their shoulder at startup like berg who are use new techniqu like artifici intellig to develop drug faster and cheaper reutersbrendan mcdermid healthcar is a huge emotivesubject and one that peopl feel passion aboutth negat press which therano and 23andm have attract recent could potenti delaypeopl willing to adopt theus of cut edg technolog narain howev disagre see the work compani like berg sentientand organovo are do as complet differ i think it is separ becaus their busi model is use the sampl to perform a test a sequenc and the issu that come up are privaci and predict what we are do is show the diseas exist and predict of the folk that have the diseas how you are go to respond the regul have also chang their tune of late say narain and are now askingformolecular adapt trial mean the stumbl block prevent this new way of develop drug from acceler are disappearingadd to this the us govern 215 million pledg precis medicin genet plan announc by presid barack obamain januari and a similar scheme in the uk call genom englandwhich 23andm is take part in and it appear as if offici want tbi revolut to happen as much as those drive it noth prevent us live forev so just how far could this technolog take usforgac who want to becom a medic doctor when he was young but say he chicken out becaus he faint at the sight of bloodmay say he is eager to play down the potenti of organovos3d bio print technolog but in the same breadth is happi to show us a vision of the futur where he has found the fountain of youth as bizarr as it might sound there is not theoret proven limit to longev said forgacsw could live forev we dont becaus we are like an automobil and have part and those part get worn off and eventu we disappear but what if we could inde replac our organ with the bio print one this futur if it is even possiblei still a long way off but so too say blondeau is anoth potenti stumbl block when it come to the general public embrac this technologyelon musk and stephen hawk may warn usof the potenti danger of ai but sentient ceo say we are nowher near thatpoint i do not believ for one second that what we are do or what other are do in the industri is danger we are not there yet it will take a long time for this to becom this out of control scienc fiction stuff
