work at thestartup in bristol whereh had move after shazamwilliam start think about how to releas the app the whole thing came togeth pretti quick he said in june he quit his job start contract as a develop for compani that need an app built and brought in a friend of a friend damon brown to help with the launch tinder is huge grindr is also huge so if what you want is a hookup your veri well serv by exist app butthat isnt what everybodi want and i think even a lot of peopl who are on tinder that not what they want allth time brown a journalist and author of a few book about intimaci and technolog look a bit like will smith with a wide welcom smile and glass that frame his warm brown eye for the next three month william and brown laid out the groundwork for the launch discuss what work and what didnt who the target market was go to beand tri to figur out how they want to approach the media we had to think about it on a deeper level becaus it had never been done befor said brown mean an app like cuddlr when the app launch for io at the end of septemb last year the team was expect around 50 to 100 download in that first week the hype cycl begin william and brown cowrot a stori on medium about the import of the app in societi and william did an exclus interview with salon publish on the day of cuddlr releas it spark a larg globalmedia attent no one imagin that it would take off so quick so we had concentr on ship the mvp minimum viabl product to get feedback from earli user plan to fix bug and roll out featur gradual as the audienc grew brown said unfortun the surg of traffic earli on led to mani user see an error send request pop up whenev they tri to request a cuddl or send a messag like tinder cuddlr was link through a facebook or twitter profil to ensur that the user was an actual person to add an extra level of safeti cuddlr use an upvotedownvot system to help peopledecidewheth to cuddl with someon an upvot was given if someon cuddl with that person and thought the person was nice a downvot or report was when a user who cuddl with the person felt uncomfort for some reason i think it import to not tri to chang a cuddl into someth that is more than a cuddl said william cuddlr encourag peopl to meet up in public space and outlin in section nine of itsterm and condit that it could block anyon or delet content list a number of reason whi it might do so includ term like harass intimid and offens to block someon the appneed to receiv complaint from other user outlin the unwelcomebehavior tinder is hugegrindr is also huge so if what you want is a hookup your veri well serv by exist app william said but that isnt what everybodi want and i think even a lot of peopl who are on tinder that not what they want all the time instead cuddlr was for peopl who want to make a connect with somebodi and then go about their day if that person happen to make an amaz impress then that great and they could plan to meet up with them again not alway so platon there were warn sign right from the start one user georg whom ireach through the app saidhi veri first cuddlr experi got awkwardh said they talk on the phone a few time befor decid to meet up he suggest a public place but she want to come to his apart in manhattan sinc she live just a block away he didnt feel total comfort with her just come over so i said ok let meet on a corner and then walk to my place he told me it was a fun experi he said the cuddl itself was good it was veri friend he also mention that the woman want more than a cuddl which he declin after my experi with this person i kind of got the sens that a lot of peopl were use cuddlr as a hookup app rather than a cuddl app which is fine if the woman initi that but it can send a weird messag he said after the app launch william stop contract and start work on it full time the team also decid to make thing more offici with william as the founder and developerbrown as cofound as well as do media outreach social media and custom supportand kulak take more of a silent partner role in the compani the whole project was bootstrap use their own money although william wouldnt reveal exact how much and eventu the revenu from in app ad to pay for the server cost which william said were up to about 300 a month lastnovemb that is when the partnersstart look serious for angel investor so they could final pay themselv and hire some more coder to help william with the grow number of error that were show up in his inbox daili thank to the 236000 download 133000 of which were in the us and 10000 daili activ user a daili activ user was count on william system as anyon who open the app one of the biggest challeng we had was to show to peopl that were not a date app to have three peopl code the app instead of one would be a big improv in term of what we can offer and how fast we can fix thing william said in novemb ive got the peopl i just need to get this seed round go so we can do it be far apart with william in england and brown in california they would often set up a skype updat session earli in the morn brown time then continu to email each other throughout the day with what they had done and were plan on do william usual work from home split his time amongcod interview and fundrais for brown it was more about get peopl to see cuddlr as differ from tinder one of the biggest challeng we had was to show to peopl that were not a date app he said cuddlr color scheme was one of the way the team tri to differenti the app and portray a more platon tone use the green and blue to help give a calmer feel than the bright red of tinder despit this the team spent a lot of time after the app was releas tri to get peopl to understand how it work peopl seem to think that the app is like this giant robot arm that will grab them and anoth stranger and just sort of mash them togeth said william that you are somehow give up autonomi or that use the app is like a form of consent and that complet untru a coupl embrac at the san fermin festiv in pamplona northern spain juli 8 2015 reuterseloy alonso to chang these idea they expand their outreach explain that when look at peopl and send a cuddl request through the app user were start a convers rather than agre to do ani particularth tinder is clear and easi to understand it consensu and it veri action orient said mark morman director of graduat studi at baylor univers depart of communic studi he say that with cuddlr there is more ambigu you have this sort of so your just go to come over and cuddl ok so what doe that mean this uncertainti is becaus one person involv in arrang the cuddl could think it is go to lead to more intim act or they want a cuddl that is more intim than the other person want william said that ani time someth call for peopl to chang their behavior some will find it threaten and that cuddlr is in the stage that onlin date was 10 year ago with peopl say oh god it a new thing and not quit accept the concept of platon intimaci one of the reason cuddlr might not work accord to morman could be explain by a theori from research kori floyd that peopl are not affection with everybodi becaus we view affect as a limit resourc were onli realli affection with a few peopl said morman even with the peopl we do share affect with we dont all share it necessarili at the same level he did say howev that the concept of cuddlr and seek touch from a stranger speak to the social need we all have to feel accept and feel affect we cant meet those need by ourselv he said but we have to have it more intim than sex the physiolog and psycholog benefit of cuddl are thought to be brought about by the releas of certain hormon hesseth affect research at oregon state universitysaid two of these potenti hormon are dopamin which make you feel happi and cortisol the level of which go down when a person receiv affect while these are two option that research have been look at the main hormon that is thought to produc these benefit is oxytocin a neurohormon also refer to as the bond hormon becaus it is produc after orgasm and breastfeed it like a job well done hormon that help us feel warm and safe and close hess said david hamilton a biolog and medicin chemistri expert who work in the pharmaceut industri for four year develop drug for cardiovascular diseas and cancer say that hug is liter like turn on the tap in the sink but the tap is the oxytocin in your bodi that start to flow through your arteri he said the oxytocin soak up atom known as free radic which trigger cardiovascular diseas and inflamm i often make a joke that you can produc oxytocin by hug a tree if hug the tree make you feel connect he told me chines artist zhou jie left and her boyfriend lian xi hug each other to sleep on an unfinish iron wire bed in beij aug 20 2014 reutersjason lee so would cuddl a stranger produc the same effect as cuddl someon you have an establish emot connect with it wouldnt produc as much oxytocin hamilton said but it will still produc some becaus the actual physic contact itself produc the oxytocin you would just produc more of it if you enjoy it hess agre say that it might not be quit as good as have a hug from a love one but that it could still be help whi do peopl then pay stranger to cuddl them when you pay a profession it more certain what your go to get when your go to get it and everyth is kind of set up befor said jacquelin samuel 32 a profession cuddler who work out of the snuggeri a commerci space in rochest new york which she said look like an apart when you walk in bed and all samuel said she has termin relationship with client in the past becaus they tri to take thing beyond the profession realm but that she hasnt had a new client in two year one of the biggest challeng in interact with peopl through app is that mani of the typic social cue we reli on to assess a person trustworthi credibl and motiv are taken away said kati davi coauthor of the book the app generat in the book she lay out two term peopl that are app enabl use technolog as a way of express themselv and be creativ a person that is app depend look to technolog for all the answer to their question feel veri tie to it almost lost and anxious without it she said these peopl want everyth includ intimaci with the push of a button but it doesnt work that way so whi are peopl then ok with meet up with a stranger via an app like tinder and have an intim interact such as sex morman say this is becaus societi doesnt necessarili see sex as an intim thing in itself a coupl look over the syrian area of quneitra from mount bental in the isra occupi golan height aug 21 2015 reutersbaz ratner intimaci is a feel of psycholog or emot close he said those sex hookup app they take that out of the equat so it isnt about intimaci it isnt about love it not about connect it just strip it out and i think it make it easier for peopl hess agre say that with sexual intimaci we know more of what to expect and what is acceptablew dont know veri much what the end game is with cuddl for half an hour he said this might be one of the reason whi women in particular are not as comfort meet up through cuddlr compar to tinder and becaus of concern for their safeti when plan to cuddl with a man anoth reason said heather schlegel a social scientist who studi futur trend particular those relat to intimaci and relationship like cuddlr is that women tend to be more touchi feeli with their femal friend hug more and kiss on the cheek wherea that just not social accept for guy goodby cuddlr hello spoonr on the morn of monday march 16 2015 william and brown post a link to a medium post with the comment onelasthug today cuddlr close up shop thank for all the love in the medium post titl

up brown wrote a week after the releas of the app william inbox was flood most with bug report and his job was to fix these as soon as he could cuddlr buildsucceed great idea but i frequent receiv quotnetwork errorquot is the issu known httpstco0i0k6xqdso mdash andrea hahn hahneandrea januari 20 2015 at the begin it was constant he said about the technic issu i dont function well on a lack of sleep but i was do 14 16 hour day this time was split between eight hour of code the app and fix the issu and eight hour of be the ceo and tri to rais fund those two job plus sleep leav you no other time i did that for a few week he said one of the main problem with chase down angel investor onc the app was releas was that there was no revenu come in from the start so brown and william were also work long hour with no incom it veri difficult onc youv launch to give investor a sens of time pressur becaus they can alway just wait and everi day they wait they learn more about whether your go to be success or not he said there was a point where this was cost me money and generat zero revenu includ ad was the onli way to keep the app afloat otherwis william would have had to shut it down in novemb last year if he were to do it all over again he say he would rais fundsbefor the launch so what did the app end up cost him each month i havent ad it up not a huge amount he said at no point were we burn 1000 a month that safe to say in term of the way it ran there was veri littl cost in decemb he took a break and stay in a cabin in saskatchewan in canada for a week get back into work long day on cuddlr was hard and he start to question whether he realli want to continu at that level of commit especi sinc the number werent move up and there was no great investor support for the app in januari william and brown start talk about shut it down while they say there were still a lot of peopl benefit from it the number were not high enough to warrant both of them work on it full time anymor onc the app close the team receiv a new flood of email this time from user of the app lament it end an email came through of somebodi say here whi i found cuddlr so help im sorri that it not go

isnt this work he also said the peopl for whom the app serv a deep purpos were often drown out even in the team mind by the peopl who were sure it was anoth date app for brown shut down the app was more about know when to let go and move on to the next thing weve had a onc in a lifetim ride and part of respect that ride is respect when it is over he said so we werent go to let it get to the point where our user arent be serv or that we burnt ourselv out to the point where we didnt even want to talk about it anymor one of the thing they tri to encourag in the postmortem was the idea that the convers about platon intimaci had alreadi start and that peopl could continu to talk about it perhap eventu chang the cultur norm after the app shut down they alltook a littl break were exhaust all of us said brown back in march this is the tiredest ive been in a veri long time now that the dust from cuddlr has settl the team member are slowli move on kulak is continu with his design work
