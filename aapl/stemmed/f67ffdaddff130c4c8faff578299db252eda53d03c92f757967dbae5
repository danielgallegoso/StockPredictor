take these word as gospelin a world where win is everyth inde when strickler step up to becom ceo of kickstartertwo year ago even he felt the pressur when i first step into the ceo seat i felt the weight of the compani on my shoulder and i also felt the nois of this kind of stuff and it realli made me question who i am made me ask do i need to be this person to succeed to be more aggress to be more ruthless than the next guy the bespectacledstrickl is an engag and enthusiast propon for choos a differ path go this rout may mean a compani doe not becometh next appl or googl but accord to
