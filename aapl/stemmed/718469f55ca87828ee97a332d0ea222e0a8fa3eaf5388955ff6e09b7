2015-10-30  10 30 london when i review smartphon i have a litmus test which tell me whether i realli like the devic if i tell my famili and friend about it if i want to tell them who made it what i think of it and get their opinion then it guarante im a fan for the past coupl of weeksi havebeen tell anyon who would listen and some who wouldnt about the phone i am current use the huawei mate s havent heard of it that not surpris especi if you are in the us statesid huawei brand is synonym with low cost budget devic and nation secur risk but with a renew market push sport sponsorshipsit recent high profil partnership with googl on the nexus 6p and the stunningm sthat could be about to chang stunningdesign the minut i pick up the mate s i knew this was someth an order of magnitud better than ani of huawei past entri it felt like someth from appl samsung or htc from an aesthet point of view it is a blend of htcs one smartphon appl iphon and the samsung galaxi s6 edg the huawei mate s is one of the best smartphon of 2015 but may not get a us releas david gilbert it is lightweight and slim it is all metal and glass and it just feel great it has a 55 inch screen the same as the iphon 6s plus but is signific more compact than appl big phabletinde the mate s feel more like a smartphon than a phablet though that could be down to my have use too mani big phone late the front of the phone is cover in corn gorilla glass and is slight curv to make one hand useeasi in term of design flourish huawei has kept thing simpl the onli thing break the phonessleek line isth camera len which protrud slight in the centerof the metalliccov on the backspeak of the backit complement bya similar shape indent where the fingerprint reader sit fingerprint let me talk about thatfingerprint sensor for a minut it is lightn quick and it posit on the rear make much more sens than on the home button where most manufactur put it you can unlock your phone instant use the sensor and it work well over 90 percent of the time for me even when my finger were wetor when my son had cover the phone in weetabix i think it could be myfavorit featur on the phone the fingerprint reader on the mate s is lightn fast and well posit david gilbert the phone 55 inch screen is big and while the resolut of 1920 x 1080 is relat low compar to a lot of the android smartphon on the market rememb that appl iphon 6s plus has an ident resolut while appl use lcd ip technolog huawei has gone for amol which has pluss and minus amol screen tend to oversatur color make them pop more than normal and while the screen on the mate s tend to show color as more intens than natur it is nota major issu and you do get blacker black thank to amol i found the screen to be bright sharp and clear in all situat camera the camera too is more than servic while it is still a step below the best in the busi iphon lg g4 galaxi note 5 the 13 megapixel sensor deliv some excel imag optic imag stabil is present to make it easier to shoot blur free shot and while the realli fine detail you get from some of the better camerasout therei lack this is still a fast and respons camera that produc some stun imag the huawei mate s is slim lightweight and compact make one hand use a breez david gilbert intern the smartphon is power by huawei own kirin 935 chipset which is not the most power on the market but it allow huawei to becom more vertic integr in the way appl is with the product of it a seri chip that could make for even better phone down the road i found the devicehad no problem handl anyth i threw at it from live stream video to 3d game and more huawei previous flagship p seri devic have suffer from overh as a result of ultra slim metal bodi but that not the case with the mate s it never felt like it was go to overheat even dure intens use anoth issu slim phone have is batteri life and the 2700mahcellinsid the mate s is on the small side so i was surpris to find thebatteri on the phone lastest well into a second day which is more than the major of smartphon out thereon of the main reason for this is a featur which activ monitor which app are use the most power and alert you to shut them down this can get annoy and you can shut if off but if you need longer batteri life then it is a fantast featur emotionalproblem there is howev a big problem with the mate s and this is an issu huawei need to sort out if it seek mainstream accept in western market like the usth problem is one of emot that is the compani proprietari softwar which sit on top of android call emot ui with android be use by over 80 percent of smartphon sold today everi manufactur want tostamp their ident both in term of softwar as well as hardwar the emot ui on the mate s is the biggest stick point for the phone david gilbert it not that emot ui is realli terribl it just that it is no where near as intuit and easi to use as stock android turn the phone on for the first time and you are present with a complet differ layout with no app drawer and a boat load of pre load bloatwar that you cant remov the compani howev seem to be awar of the problem with it softwar and has appoint the women part respons for the ui of the origin iphon abigail brodi as it head of ux experi to leadit softwar effort in the futur and this can onli be a good thing us launch glitchi softwar asid this is a realli great smartphon the onli problem is that it may be difficult to get your hand on it huawei has said it has no plan initi to launch the mate s in the us as it has other phone plan for that market the mate s could howev arriv inin the usat a later date if it doe make it statesid expectth price to start atabout 720 base on price in europ and the uk the 55 inch screen has the same resolut as the iphon 6s plus david gilbert the mate s is the perfect springboard for a compani which has said it is make a renew push to promot it smartphon and wearabl in north americain marchit state it was go to push hard with tradit advertis onlin promot and sport sponsorship as itlook to counteract the negat feel toward the brand after the us governmentlabel it network equip a threat to nation secur and bar it from feder contract fellow chines compani zte has had huge success with it sport sponsorship to date and huawei will be hope to do the samelast year huawei announc it first us sport sponsorship with the nflswashington redskinsthough the move may have been somewhat tone deaf given the backlash against the dc team nicknam huaweisaid this week that it smartphon shipment in the third quarter of 2015 surg 63 percent cement it posit asth world third biggest smartphon maker sale of it premium smartphon account for one third of allrevenu show it is no longer just a budget manufactur but in the us which is
