whi he is so confid he can succeed in such a competit market we own billion of dollar of inform technolog distributionsuppli chain compani all over the worldso we have a resourc of talent that know how to run veri veri frugal expens structur we know how to run distribut in africa the middl east southeast asia central asia latin america billion dollar compani it is this expertis and knowledg built up over three decad of advis compani involv in industri such as wireless communic onlin commerc and compon manufactur that sculley indic he believ will allow obi to build and design beauti phone on a budget and still make a profit we think we can averag somewher around 8 percent but we will start out and sell pretti close to our bill of materi sculley admit say we are not just tri to make the money in the hardwar alon he ad that his experi in build compani that provid wireless communic such as metropc and inphon will open up other avenu of revenu for the compani and just how much revenu can obi bring in the smartphon market is so gigant that we think there is the potenti to build a billion dollar revenu busi steve job left and john sculley appear with a macintosh person comput in 1983 when the pair work togeth briefli at appl comput inc appl the myth that has built up around sculley and job may be factual inaccur but the man who replac job at appl is certain happi to use his connect to the world biggest compani and it charismat founder to his advantag when attempt to get attent for his new smartphon job the great negoti while talk about the challeng of break into a high commodifi busi like the smartphon industri sculley point out that job was abl to go into the music industri in the earli 2000s an equal commodifiedindustri and disrupt that by make a few small tweak and have a clear vision of what he was do i think you have to give steve job the credit for keep appl afloat he see thing in bold step but with veri simpl focus you can succeed in a commodit industri with a few clear principl sculley contend job greatest abil wasnt his skill in sell a product or envis what came next but in be a ruthless negotiatorpeopl dont alway appreci what an amaz negoti steve job was peopl know him as the showman and the visionari but his greatest strength were he could recruit talent like nobodi i have ever met and he could outmaneuv peopl in negoti like no one i have ever met and those talent are underestim so what of his former employ sculley said he believesappl willget into the automobilein some way ad that it doesnt need to do it this year or next but probabl has four or five more year of big iphon revenu to sustain it appl has yet to give ani offici indicationof what it is do in the car industri but it is clear that it is work on someth of cours job is no longer there but accord to sculley theman now at the helm is the perfect choic to lead appl into it next era especi if it is about to begin manufactur a carther is probabl no execut in the world that is better at suppli chain than tim cook which mean manag incrediblecomplex if you were to say who would you pick to do someth as complex and challeng as build a car you would have to say tim cook is probabl the most qualifi person in the world
