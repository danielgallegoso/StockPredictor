Our new optional Campaign, 'The Jungles of Lustria' brings more content and even more tactical challenge to our fans. We have also remade the start of the game, giving a much richer and exciting encounter with the deep and varied lore of the Warhammer Fantasy Battle universe. We are also introducing a series of new spells that move our game into even deeper tactical challenges, an intention we had from the get go but were unable to realize until now. With the combination of our recent price drop of 60% on the game, our improvements to the core game and a lot of additional content, we are more than a little excited to share our latest version with our fans and new players alike. We also have a lot of new development underway, so stay tuned for more exciting updates", explains Fredrik Breien, CEO of Turbo Tape Games.
