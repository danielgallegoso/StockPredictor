2015-11-10 PUNE, India, November 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The rise in adoption of transparent electronic materials in the solar panel industry has led to the remarkable growth of the global transparent electronics market, posting a CAGR of more than 59% during the forecast period. Also, increase in the demand for compact, sophisticated, and technologically advanced products is boosting the use of these materials in the display and windows segment. Complete report on global transparent electronics market spread across 60 pages, profiling 6 major companies and supported with 26 data exhibits is now available at is now available at http://www.sandlerresearch.org/global-transparent-electronics-market-2015-2019.html. TRRAM provides non-volatile memory and can be integrated with other transparent electronic components to create a see-through embedded electronic system. Using this technology, manufacturers are able to develop transparent computer monitors and TV screens. Application segmentation of the global transparent electronics market in this report covers transparent solar panels, transparent displays and transparent windows. The transparent display sector is expected to be the highest contributor to the overall global transparent electronics market by 2019, with a contribution of more than 61%. With the expansion of transparent electronics, the touch displays market will also gain traction. Corning, Saint-Gobain, Apple, and Samsung have already made sizeable investments in this technology. The global transparent electronics market is extremely competitive because of the strong position of the key vendors, hence the entry of new players turn out to be difficult due to large capital investments. Also, vendors in this market are currently investing heavily in R&D of transparent electronic prototypes to gain a competitive advantage over other market players. The key players in the global transparent electronics market are 3M, Apple, Cambrios Technologies, Corning, Saint-Gobain and Samsung Electronics. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Dontech, Evaporated Coatings, GWS Technology, Kurt J. Lesker and Sharp.
