Sporty Civic DesignThe dramatic and sporty new Civic design is grounded in its more athletic stance and low and wide proportions. Compared to the current model, the 2016 Civic Sedan is nearly 2 inches wider and 1 inch lower with a 1.2-inch longer wheelbase, featuring a more compact and sporty front overhang; a longer, more aggressively sculpted hood and fastback-style tail.
The taut and tidy proportions of the new Civic Sedan are complemented and accentuated by refined design details, including sleek and swept-back bodylines, a sharp and aggressive face and bulging wheel arches. The new Civic's more premium character is also highlighted by its available LED exterior lighting, including standard LED running lights, distinctive C-shaped LED taillights and featuring LED headlights on the Touring trim.
Two All-New PowertrainsThe 2016 Civic Sedan features two all-new, more powerful and fuel-efficient engines: Civic Sedan LX and EX trims are powered by a 2.0-liter, port-injected DOHC i-VTEC inline four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 138 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,200 rpm4 (+15 HP and +9 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to either a six-speed manual (LX trim only) or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Civic Sedan EX-T, EX-L and Touring trims are powered by a 1.5-liter, direct-injected DOHC TURBO inline 4-cylinder engine producing 174 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 162 lb.-ft. of torque from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm5 (+31 HP and +33 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to an all-new CVT with torque converter designed specifically to complement the turbocharged engine.
Both engines feature a wide array of friction-reducing design and engineering features that support both high performance and high fuel efficiency. These two ultra-efficient engines, married to the 2016 Civic Sedan's highly aerodynamic body, help to garner class-leading EPA fuel-economy ratings of 31/41/35 mpg (city/highway/combined) for models equipped with the 2.0-liter engine and CVT, 27/40/31 mpg for the 2.0L with manual transmission and 31/42/35 mpg for models equipped with the 1.5-liter TURBO.
Advanced and Sporty New Body and ChassisThe 2016 Civic sets a new standard for dynamic handling, steering, ride quality and cabin quietness in the compact class, courtesy of its all-new platform, featuring the most rigid and tightly sealed body and the most sophisticated chassis in Civic history. 
Advancing the sporty character of this all-new Civic is its more sporty driving position, with a 1-inch lower hip point compared to the outgoing model. The Civic's all-new platform design and lower floor and engine enable the lower hip point. The new Civic chassis features a redesigned strut front suspension and a new multi-link rear suspension mounted to an ultra-rigid rear subframe.
Torsional rigidity of the new body is improved by 25 percent aided in part by more intensive use of ultra-high-strength steel. Fifty-nine percent of the unit body is composed of high-strength steel, including 14 percent hot-stamp steel, an increase of one percent ultra-high-strength steel use in the previous model. Aerodynamic efficiency is improved by 12 percent to class-leading levels through detailed CFD modeling, wind tunnel testing and tuning, and from the use full underbody covers (a Civic first). 
Despite its larger size, the new Civic unit body is 68 pounds lighter than before, while new body-sealing techniques result in a 58 percent reduction in cabin air leaks. Class-leading cabin quietness is further improved by the use of premium noise-reducing features, including a flush-mounted acoustic glass windshield, a more tightly sealed engine compartment and triple-sealed doors.
To achieve the Civic development team's high targets for dynamic performance and refined ride quality, the new Civic Sedan utilizes hydraulic compliance bushings; a technology typically reserved for more expensive vehicles, aiding the isolation of road vibration. Additional new chassis technologies include variable gear-ratio steering, beefier front and rear stabilizer bars and standard four-wheel disc brakes, along with the application of new Agile Handling Assist brake-torque vectoring technology for more precise and agile cornering.
Spacious, Sophisticated and Advanced CabinThe new Civic interior is designed to offer the most comfortable, sophisticated and premium-feeling cabin in the compact class. An additional 3.2 cubic feet of interior space translates into the largest cabin in the compact segment with 1.2 inches of added rear-seat legroom versus the outgoing model. In front, new ultra-thin front roof pillars enable class-leading forward visibility. At the rear, trunk space has been increased by 2.6 cubic feet a configuration with a lower lift-over height, larger opening and wider and taller cargo area. Civic Sedan EX and higher trims will feature a 60/40 split and folding rear seat. All Civic Sedan models also feature a larger, reconfigurable new center console with up to 7.2 liters of secure storage space; approaching SUV levels of console utility.
The new Civic interior strikes a more premium tone with high-quality materials and high-contrast finishes. These include a new one-piece, soft-touch instrumental panel with molded stitching; more premium seat fabrics; a new full-color TFT center meter (EX and above trims); a center console with piano black finish and high-contrast silver bezel; door inserts with real stitching; an LED shift indicator and LED overhead lighting; and for EX and higher trims, a leather shift boot. 
The 2016 Civic Sedan offers customers more premium features than ever before. New standard equipment includes automatic climate control, auto-up/down front-power windows, an electronic parking brake with Brake Hold and Walk-Away auto door locks. Additional available premium features, depending upon trim, include heated side mirrors and remote engine start rain-sensing wipers (Touring), heated front seats (EXT and above) and heated outboard rear seats (Touring), an eight-way power driver's seat (EX-L and Touring), a four-way power front passenger's seat (Touring) and an adjustable driver's seat thigh support with 14 degrees of tilt. 
Civic Audio and ConnectivityCivic EX and higher trims come equipped with a new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen with a higher resolution Android-based operating system. The Civic joins the 2016 Accord as two of the first high-volume models to incorporate both the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms, providing seamless integration of smartphone features and functions. Smartphone connectivity for the Civic Sedan is now accomplished using a single USB cable connection.
The new Civic Sedan also delivers on the audio front with more powerful systems and expanded listening options, including SiriusXM Radio, Pandora compatibility and HD Radio. Civic LX trims feature a 160-watt, four-speaker sound system and 5-inch LCD screen for control of audio functions, while EX and EX-L trims feature a 180-watt system, eight-speaker system and utilize the new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen as the nerve center for audio and climate control. The new-line-topping Touring trim features a 450-watt, 10-speaker audio systemthe most powerful in its competitive setintegrated with Display Audio.
Finally, while all Civic models with Display Audio provide for smartphone-powered GPS navigation via the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms (with compatible smartphone and customer data plan), for customers who want an embedded navigation capability, the Civic EX-L Navi and Touring trims are equipped with an all-new Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System developed in cooperation with the experts at Garmin  offering more intuitive operation, improved graphics and enhanced mapping capabilities.
Civic Safety PerformanceThe 2016 Civic utilizes an advanced body structure  including a next generation Advanced Compatibility Body Structure (ACE), a high-strength steel floor and tailor-tempered, ultra-high-strength B-pillars and rear frame rails  to provide a high degree of occupant protection while minimizing weight and aiding fuel efficiency. The new body structure works in concert with advanced front-side and side curtain airbag technology, including SmartVent technology for the driver and front passenger side airbags.
Utilizing these systems in conjunction with the new Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies, the 2016 Civic Sedan targets the highest available U.S. safety ratings  an NCAP 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
Civic ManufacturingThe 2016 Civic Sedan marks the first time Honda's North American manufacturing operations have served as the global lead plant for a model like Civic, sold worldwide. Further, all 2016 Civic Sedans for the North American market are manufactured at the company's Alliston, Ontario, and Greensburg, Indiana, auto plants6. The two new engines for the 2016 Civics are manufactured at Honda engine plants in Anna, Ohio, and Alliston, Ontario, with the new turbo engine produced exclusively at the Anna Engine Plant. The two continuously variable automatic transmissions are being produced by Honda plants in Russells Point, Ohio, and Celaya, Mexico.

Sporty Civic DesignThe dramatic and sporty new Civic design is grounded in its more athletic stance and low and wide proportions. Compared to the current model, the 2016 Civic Sedan is nearly 2 inches wider and 1 inch lower with a 1.2-inch longer wheelbase, featuring a more compact and sporty front overhang; a longer, more aggressively sculpted hood and fastback-style tail.
The taut and tidy proportions of the new Civic Sedan are complemented and accentuated by refined design details, including sleek and swept-back bodylines, a sharp and aggressive face and bulging wheel arches. The new Civic's more premium character is also highlighted by its available LED exterior lighting, including standard LED running lights, distinctive C-shaped LED taillights and featuring LED headlights on the Touring trim.
Two All-New PowertrainsThe 2016 Civic Sedan features two all-new, more powerful and fuel-efficient engines: Civic Sedan LX and EX trims are powered by a 2.0-liter, port-injected DOHC i-VTEC inline four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 138 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,200 rpm4 (+15 HP and +9 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to either a six-speed manual (LX trim only) or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Civic Sedan EX-T, EX-L and Touring trims are powered by a 1.5-liter, direct-injected DOHC TURBO inline 4-cylinder engine producing 174 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 162 lb.-ft. of torque from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm5 (+31 HP and +33 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to an all-new CVT with torque converter designed specifically to complement the turbocharged engine.
Both engines feature a wide array of friction-reducing design and engineering features that support both high performance and high fuel efficiency. These two ultra-efficient engines, married to the 2016 Civic Sedan's highly aerodynamic body, help to garner class-leading EPA fuel-economy ratings of 31/41/35 mpg (city/highway/combined) for models equipped with the 2.0-liter engine and CVT, 27/40/31 mpg for the 2.0L with manual transmission and 31/42/35 mpg for models equipped with the 1.5-liter TURBO.
Advanced and Sporty New Body and ChassisThe 2016 Civic sets a new standard for dynamic handling, steering, ride quality and cabin quietness in the compact class, courtesy of its all-new platform, featuring the most rigid and tightly sealed body and the most sophisticated chassis in Civic history. 
Advancing the sporty character of this all-new Civic is its more sporty driving position, with a 1-inch lower hip point compared to the outgoing model. The Civic's all-new platform design and lower floor and engine enable the lower hip point. The new Civic chassis features a redesigned strut front suspension and a new multi-link rear suspension mounted to an ultra-rigid rear subframe.
Torsional rigidity of the new body is improved by 25 percent aided in part by more intensive use of ultra-high-strength steel. Fifty-nine percent of the unit body is composed of high-strength steel, including 14 percent hot-stamp steel, an increase of one percent ultra-high-strength steel use in the previous model. Aerodynamic efficiency is improved by 12 percent to class-leading levels through detailed CFD modeling, wind tunnel testing and tuning, and from the use full underbody covers (a Civic first). 
Despite its larger size, the new Civic unit body is 68 pounds lighter than before, while new body-sealing techniques result in a 58 percent reduction in cabin air leaks. Class-leading cabin quietness is further improved by the use of premium noise-reducing features, including a flush-mounted acoustic glass windshield, a more tightly sealed engine compartment and triple-sealed doors.
To achieve the Civic development team's high targets for dynamic performance and refined ride quality, the new Civic Sedan utilizes hydraulic compliance bushings; a technology typically reserved for more expensive vehicles, aiding the isolation of road vibration. Additional new chassis technologies include variable gear-ratio steering, beefier front and rear stabilizer bars and standard four-wheel disc brakes, along with the application of new Agile Handling Assist brake-torque vectoring technology for more precise and agile cornering.
Spacious, Sophisticated and Advanced CabinThe new Civic interior is designed to offer the most comfortable, sophisticated and premium-feeling cabin in the compact class. An additional 3.2 cubic feet of interior space translates into the largest cabin in the compact segment with 1.2 inches of added rear-seat legroom versus the outgoing model. In front, new ultra-thin front roof pillars enable class-leading forward visibility. At the rear, trunk space has been increased by 2.6 cubic feet a configuration with a lower lift-over height, larger opening and wider and taller cargo area. Civic Sedan EX and higher trims will feature a 60/40 split and folding rear seat. All Civic Sedan models also feature a larger, reconfigurable new center console with up to 7.2 liters of secure storage space; approaching SUV levels of console utility.
The new Civic interior strikes a more premium tone with high-quality materials and high-contrast finishes. These include a new one-piece, soft-touch instrumental panel with molded stitching; more premium seat fabrics; a new full-color TFT center meter (EX and above trims); a center console with piano black finish and high-contrast silver bezel; door inserts with real stitching; an LED shift indicator and LED overhead lighting; and for EX and higher trims, a leather shift boot. 
The 2016 Civic Sedan offers customers more premium features than ever before. New standard equipment includes automatic climate control, auto-up/down front-power windows, an electronic parking brake with Brake Hold and Walk-Away auto door locks. Additional available premium features, depending upon trim, include heated side mirrors and remote engine start rain-sensing wipers (Touring), heated front seats (EXT and above) and heated outboard rear seats (Touring), an eight-way power driver's seat (EX-L and Touring), a four-way power front passenger's seat (Touring) and an adjustable driver's seat thigh support with 14 degrees of tilt. 
Civic Audio and ConnectivityCivic EX and higher trims come equipped with a new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen with a higher resolution Android-based operating system. The Civic joins the 2016 Accord as two of the first high-volume models to incorporate both the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms, providing seamless integration of smartphone features and functions. Smartphone connectivity for the Civic Sedan is now accomplished using a single USB cable connection.
The new Civic Sedan also delivers on the audio front with more powerful systems and expanded listening options, including SiriusXM Radio, Pandora compatibility and HD Radio. Civic LX trims feature a 160-watt, four-speaker sound system and 5-inch LCD screen for control of audio functions, while EX and EX-L trims feature a 180-watt system, eight-speaker system and utilize the new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen as the nerve center for audio and climate control. The new-line-topping Touring trim features a 450-watt, 10-speaker audio systemthe most powerful in its competitive setintegrated with Display Audio.
Finally, while all Civic models with Display Audio provide for smartphone-powered GPS navigation via the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms (with compatible smartphone and customer data plan), for customers who want an embedded navigation capability, the Civic EX-L Navi and Touring trims are equipped with an all-new Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System developed in cooperation with the experts at Garmin  offering more intuitive operation, improved graphics and enhanced mapping capabilities.
Civic Safety PerformanceThe 2016 Civic utilizes an advanced body structure  including a next generation Advanced Compatibility Body Structure (ACE), a high-strength steel floor and tailor-tempered, ultra-high-strength B-pillars and rear frame rails  to provide a high degree of occupant protection while minimizing weight and aiding fuel efficiency. The new body structure works in concert with advanced front-side and side curtain airbag technology, including SmartVent technology for the driver and front passenger side airbags.
Utilizing these systems in conjunction with the new Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies, the 2016 Civic Sedan targets the highest available U.S. safety ratings  an NCAP 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
Civic ManufacturingThe 2016 Civic Sedan marks the first time Honda's North American manufacturing operations have served as the global lead plant for a model like Civic, sold worldwide. Further, all 2016 Civic Sedans for the North American market are manufactured at the company's Alliston, Ontario, and Greensburg, Indiana, auto plants6.

The new Civic's more premium character is also highlighted by its available LED exterior lighting, including standard LED running lights, distinctive C-shaped LED taillights and featuring LED headlights on the Touring trim.
Two All-New PowertrainsThe 2016 Civic Sedan features two all-new, more powerful and fuel-efficient engines: Civic Sedan LX and EX trims are powered by a 2.0-liter, port-injected DOHC i-VTEC inline four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 138 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,200 rpm4 (+15 HP and +9 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to either a six-speed manual (LX trim only) or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Civic Sedan EX-T, EX-L and Touring trims are powered by a 1.5-liter, direct-injected DOHC TURBO inline 4-cylinder engine producing 174 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 162 lb.-ft. of torque from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm5 (+31 HP and +33 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to an all-new CVT with torque converter designed specifically to complement the turbocharged engine.
Both engines feature a wide array of friction-reducing design and engineering features that support both high performance and high fuel efficiency. These two ultra-efficient engines, married to the 2016 Civic Sedan's highly aerodynamic body, help to garner class-leading EPA fuel-economy ratings of 31/41/35 mpg (city/highway/combined) for models equipped with the 2.0-liter engine and CVT, 27/40/31 mpg for the 2.0L with manual transmission and 31/42/35 mpg for models equipped with the 1.5-liter TURBO.
Advanced and Sporty New Body and ChassisThe 2016 Civic sets a new standard for dynamic handling, steering, ride quality and cabin quietness in the compact class, courtesy of its all-new platform, featuring the most rigid and tightly sealed body and the most sophisticated chassis in Civic history. 
Advancing the sporty character of this all-new Civic is its more sporty driving position, with a 1-inch lower hip point compared to the outgoing model. The Civic's all-new platform design and lower floor and engine enable the lower hip point. The new Civic chassis features a redesigned strut front suspension and a new multi-link rear suspension mounted to an ultra-rigid rear subframe.
Torsional rigidity of the new body is improved by 25 percent aided in part by more intensive use of ultra-high-strength steel. Fifty-nine percent of the unit body is composed of high-strength steel, including 14 percent hot-stamp steel, an increase of one percent ultra-high-strength steel use in the previous model. Aerodynamic efficiency is improved by 12 percent to class-leading levels through detailed CFD modeling, wind tunnel testing and tuning, and from the use full underbody covers (a Civic first). 
Despite its larger size, the new Civic unit body is 68 pounds lighter than before, while new body-sealing techniques result in a 58 percent reduction in cabin air leaks. Class-leading cabin quietness is further improved by the use of premium noise-reducing features, including a flush-mounted acoustic glass windshield, a more tightly sealed engine compartment and triple-sealed doors.
To achieve the Civic development team's high targets for dynamic performance and refined ride quality, the new Civic Sedan utilizes hydraulic compliance bushings; a technology typically reserved for more expensive vehicles, aiding the isolation of road vibration. Additional new chassis technologies include variable gear-ratio steering, beefier front and rear stabilizer bars and standard four-wheel disc brakes, along with the application of new Agile Handling Assist brake-torque vectoring technology for more precise and agile cornering.
Spacious, Sophisticated and Advanced CabinThe new Civic interior is designed to offer the most comfortable, sophisticated and premium-feeling cabin in the compact class. An additional 3.2 cubic feet of interior space translates into the largest cabin in the compact segment with 1.2 inches of added rear-seat legroom versus the outgoing model. In front, new ultra-thin front roof pillars enable class-leading forward visibility. At the rear, trunk space has been increased by 2.6 cubic feet a configuration with a lower lift-over height, larger opening and wider and taller cargo area. Civic Sedan EX and higher trims will feature a 60/40 split and folding rear seat. All Civic Sedan models also feature a larger, reconfigurable new center console with up to 7.2 liters of secure storage space; approaching SUV levels of console utility.
The new Civic interior strikes a more premium tone with high-quality materials and high-contrast finishes. These include a new one-piece, soft-touch instrumental panel with molded stitching; more premium seat fabrics; a new full-color TFT center meter (EX and above trims); a center console with piano black finish and high-contrast silver bezel; door inserts with real stitching; an LED shift indicator and LED overhead lighting; and for EX and higher trims, a leather shift boot. 
The 2016 Civic Sedan offers customers more premium features than ever before. New standard equipment includes automatic climate control, auto-up/down front-power windows, an electronic parking brake with Brake Hold and Walk-Away auto door locks. Additional available premium features, depending upon trim, include heated side mirrors and remote engine start rain-sensing wipers (Touring), heated front seats (EXT and above) and heated outboard rear seats (Touring), an eight-way power driver's seat (EX-L and Touring), a four-way power front passenger's seat (Touring) and an adjustable driver's seat thigh support with 14 degrees of tilt. 
Civic Audio and ConnectivityCivic EX and higher trims come equipped with a new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen with a higher resolution Android-based operating system. The Civic joins the 2016 Accord as two of the first high-volume models to incorporate both the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms, providing seamless integration of smartphone features and functions. Smartphone connectivity for the Civic Sedan is now accomplished using a single USB cable connection.
The new Civic Sedan also delivers on the audio front with more powerful systems and expanded listening options, including SiriusXM Radio, Pandora compatibility and HD Radio. Civic LX trims feature a 160-watt, four-speaker sound system and 5-inch LCD screen for control of audio functions, while EX and EX-L trims feature a 180-watt system, eight-speaker system and utilize the new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen as the nerve center for audio and climate control. The new-line-topping Touring trim features a 450-watt, 10-speaker audio systemthe most powerful in its competitive setintegrated with Display Audio.
Finally, while all Civic models with Display Audio provide for smartphone-powered GPS navigation via the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms (with compatible smartphone and customer data plan), for customers who want an embedded navigation capability, the Civic EX-L Navi and Touring trims are equipped with an all-new Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System developed in cooperation with the experts at Garmin  offering more intuitive operation, improved graphics and enhanced mapping capabilities.
Civic Safety PerformanceThe 2016 Civic utilizes an advanced body structure  including a next generation Advanced Compatibility Body Structure (ACE), a high-strength steel floor and tailor-tempered, ultra-high-strength B-pillars and rear frame rails  to provide a high degree of occupant protection while minimizing weight and aiding fuel efficiency. The new body structure works in concert with advanced front-side and side curtain airbag technology, including SmartVent technology for the driver and front passenger side airbags.
Utilizing these systems in conjunction with the new Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies, the 2016 Civic Sedan targets the highest available U.S. safety ratings  an NCAP 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).

Sporty Civic DesignThe dramatic and sporty new Civic design is grounded in its more athletic stance and low and wide proportions. Compared to the current model, the 2016 Civic Sedan is nearly 2 inches wider and 1 inch lower with a 1.2-inch longer wheelbase, featuring a more compact and sporty front overhang; a longer, more aggressively sculpted hood and fastback-style tail.
The taut and tidy proportions of the new Civic Sedan are complemented and accentuated by refined design details, including sleek and swept-back bodylines, a sharp and aggressive face and bulging wheel arches. The new Civic's more premium character is also highlighted by its available LED exterior lighting, including standard LED running lights, distinctive C-shaped LED taillights and featuring LED headlights on the Touring trim.
Two All-New PowertrainsThe 2016 Civic Sedan features two all-new, more powerful and fuel-efficient engines: Civic Sedan LX and EX trims are powered by a 2.0-liter, port-injected DOHC i-VTEC inline four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 138 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,200 rpm4 (+15 HP and +9 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to either a six-speed manual (LX trim only) or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Civic Sedan EX-T, EX-L and Touring trims are powered by a 1.5-liter, direct-injected DOHC TURBO inline 4-cylinder engine producing 174 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 162 lb.-ft. of torque from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm5 (+31 HP and +33 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to an all-new CVT with torque converter designed specifically to complement the turbocharged engine.
Both engines feature a wide array of friction-reducing design and engineering features that support both high performance and high fuel efficiency. These two ultra-efficient engines, married to the 2016 Civic Sedan's highly aerodynamic body, help to garner class-leading EPA fuel-economy ratings of 31/41/35 mpg (city/highway/combined) for models equipped with the 2.0-liter engine and CVT, 27/40/31 mpg for the 2.0L with manual transmission and 31/42/35 mpg for models equipped with the 1.5-liter TURBO.
Advanced and Sporty New Body and ChassisThe 2016 Civic sets a new standard for dynamic handling, steering, ride quality and cabin quietness in the compact class, courtesy of its all-new platform, featuring the most rigid and tightly sealed body and the most sophisticated chassis in Civic history. 
Advancing the sporty character of this all-new Civic is its more sporty driving position, with a 1-inch lower hip point compared to the outgoing model. The Civic's all-new platform design and lower floor and engine enable the lower hip point. The new Civic chassis features a redesigned strut front suspension and a new multi-link rear suspension mounted to an ultra-rigid rear subframe.
Torsional rigidity of the new body is improved by 25 percent aided in part by more intensive use of ultra-high-strength steel. Fifty-nine percent of the unit body is composed of high-strength steel, including 14 percent hot-stamp steel, an increase of one percent ultra-high-strength steel use in the previous model. Aerodynamic efficiency is improved by 12 percent to class-leading levels through detailed CFD modeling, wind tunnel testing and tuning, and from the use full underbody covers (a Civic first). 
Despite its larger size, the new Civic unit body is 68 pounds lighter than before, while new body-sealing techniques result in a 58 percent reduction in cabin air leaks. Class-leading cabin quietness is further improved by the use of premium noise-reducing features, including a flush-mounted acoustic glass windshield, a more tightly sealed engine compartment and triple-sealed doors.
To achieve the Civic development team's high targets for dynamic performance and refined ride quality, the new Civic Sedan utilizes hydraulic compliance bushings; a technology typically reserved for more expensive vehicles, aiding the isolation of road vibration. Additional new chassis technologies include variable gear-ratio steering, beefier front and rear stabilizer bars and standard four-wheel disc brakes, along with the application of new Agile Handling Assist brake-torque vectoring technology for more precise and agile cornering.
Spacious, Sophisticated and Advanced CabinThe new Civic interior is designed to offer the most comfortable, sophisticated and premium-feeling cabin in the compact class. An additional 3.2 cubic feet of interior space translates into the largest cabin in the compact segment with 1.2 inches of added rear-seat legroom versus the outgoing model. In front, new ultra-thin front roof pillars enable class-leading forward visibility. At the rear, trunk space has been increased by 2.6 cubic feet a configuration with a lower lift-over height, larger opening and wider and taller cargo area. Civic Sedan EX and higher trims will feature a 60/40 split and folding rear seat. All Civic Sedan models also feature a larger, reconfigurable new center console with up to 7.2 liters of secure storage space; approaching SUV levels of console utility.
The new Civic interior strikes a more premium tone with high-quality materials and high-contrast finishes. These include a new one-piece, soft-touch instrumental panel with molded stitching; more premium seat fabrics; a new full-color TFT center meter (EX and above trims); a center console with piano black finish and high-contrast silver bezel; door inserts with real stitching; an LED shift indicator and LED overhead lighting; and for EX and higher trims, a leather shift boot. 
The 2016 Civic Sedan offers customers more premium features than ever before. New standard equipment includes automatic climate control, auto-up/down front-power windows, an electronic parking brake with Brake Hold and Walk-Away auto door locks. Additional available premium features, depending upon trim, include heated side mirrors and remote engine start rain-sensing wipers (Touring), heated front seats (EXT and above) and heated outboard rear seats (Touring), an eight-way power driver's seat (EX-L and Touring), a four-way power front passenger's seat (Touring) and an adjustable driver's seat thigh support with 14 degrees of tilt. 
Civic Audio and ConnectivityCivic EX and higher trims come equipped with a new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen with a higher resolution Android-based operating system. The Civic joins the 2016 Accord as two of the first high-volume models to incorporate both the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms, providing seamless integration of smartphone features and functions. Smartphone connectivity for the Civic Sedan is now accomplished using a single USB cable connection.
The new Civic Sedan also delivers on the audio front with more powerful systems and expanded listening options, including SiriusXM Radio, Pandora compatibility and HD Radio. Civic LX trims feature a 160-watt, four-speaker sound system and 5-inch LCD screen for control of audio functions, while EX and EX-L trims feature a 180-watt system, eight-speaker system and utilize the new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen as the nerve center for audio and climate control. The new-line-topping Touring trim features a 450-watt, 10-speaker audio systemthe most powerful in its competitive setintegrated with Display Audio.
Finally, while all Civic models with Display Audio provide for smartphone-powered GPS navigation via the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms (with compatible smartphone and customer data plan), for customers who want an embedded navigation capability, the Civic EX-L Navi and Touring trims are equipped with an all-new Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System developed in cooperation with the experts at Garmin  offering more intuitive operation, improved graphics and enhanced mapping capabilities.

Sporty Civic DesignThe dramatic and sporty new Civic design is grounded in its more athletic stance and low and wide proportions. Compared to the current model, the 2016 Civic Sedan is nearly 2 inches wider and 1 inch lower with a 1.2-inch longer wheelbase, featuring a more compact and sporty front overhang; a longer, more aggressively sculpted hood and fastback-style tail.
The taut and tidy proportions of the new Civic Sedan are complemented and accentuated by refined design details, including sleek and swept-back bodylines, a sharp and aggressive face and bulging wheel arches. The new Civic's more premium character is also highlighted by its available LED exterior lighting, including standard LED running lights, distinctive C-shaped LED taillights and featuring LED headlights on the Touring trim.
Two All-New PowertrainsThe 2016 Civic Sedan features two all-new, more powerful and fuel-efficient engines: Civic Sedan LX and EX trims are powered by a 2.0-liter, port-injected DOHC i-VTEC inline four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 138 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,200 rpm4 (+15 HP and +9 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to either a six-speed manual (LX trim only) or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Civic Sedan EX-T, EX-L and Touring trims are powered by a 1.5-liter, direct-injected DOHC TURBO inline 4-cylinder engine producing 174 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 162 lb.-ft. of torque from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm5 (+31 HP and +33 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to an all-new CVT with torque converter designed specifically to complement the turbocharged engine.
Both engines feature a wide array of friction-reducing design and engineering features that support both high performance and high fuel efficiency. These two ultra-efficient engines, married to the 2016 Civic Sedan's highly aerodynamic body, help to garner class-leading EPA fuel-economy ratings of 31/41/35 mpg (city/highway/combined) for models equipped with the 2.0-liter engine and CVT, 27/40/31 mpg for the 2.0L with manual transmission and 31/42/35 mpg for models equipped with the 1.5-liter TURBO.
Advanced and Sporty New Body and ChassisThe 2016 Civic sets a new standard for dynamic handling, steering, ride quality and cabin quietness in the compact class, courtesy of its all-new platform, featuring the most rigid and tightly sealed body and the most sophisticated chassis in Civic history. 
Advancing the sporty character of this all-new Civic is its more sporty driving position, with a 1-inch lower hip point compared to the outgoing model. The Civic's all-new platform design and lower floor and engine enable the lower hip point. The new Civic chassis features a redesigned strut front suspension and a new multi-link rear suspension mounted to an ultra-rigid rear subframe.
Torsional rigidity of the new body is improved by 25 percent aided in part by more intensive use of ultra-high-strength steel. Fifty-nine percent of the unit body is composed of high-strength steel, including 14 percent hot-stamp steel, an increase of one percent ultra-high-strength steel use in the previous model. Aerodynamic efficiency is improved by 12 percent to class-leading levels through detailed CFD modeling, wind tunnel testing and tuning, and from the use full underbody covers (a Civic first). 
Despite its larger size, the new Civic unit body is 68 pounds lighter than before, while new body-sealing techniques result in a 58 percent reduction in cabin air leaks. Class-leading cabin quietness is further improved by the use of premium noise-reducing features, including a flush-mounted acoustic glass windshield, a more tightly sealed engine compartment and triple-sealed doors.
To achieve the Civic development team's high targets for dynamic performance and refined ride quality, the new Civic Sedan utilizes hydraulic compliance bushings; a technology typically reserved for more expensive vehicles, aiding the isolation of road vibration. Additional new chassis technologies include variable gear-ratio steering, beefier front and rear stabilizer bars and standard four-wheel disc brakes, along with the application of new Agile Handling Assist brake-torque vectoring technology for more precise and agile cornering.
Spacious, Sophisticated and Advanced CabinThe new Civic interior is designed to offer the most comfortable, sophisticated and premium-feeling cabin in the compact class. An additional 3.2 cubic feet of interior space translates into the largest cabin in the compact segment with 1.2 inches of added rear-seat legroom versus the outgoing model. In front, new ultra-thin front roof pillars enable class-leading forward visibility. At the rear, trunk space has been increased by 2.6 cubic feet a configuration with a lower lift-over height, larger opening and wider and taller cargo area. Civic Sedan EX and higher trims will feature a 60/40 split and folding rear seat. All Civic Sedan models also feature a larger, reconfigurable new center console with up to 7.2 liters of secure storage space; approaching SUV levels of console utility.
The new Civic interior strikes a more premium tone with high-quality materials and high-contrast finishes. These include a new one-piece, soft-touch instrumental panel with molded stitching; more premium seat fabrics; a new full-color TFT center meter (EX and above trims); a center console with piano black finish and high-contrast silver bezel; door inserts with real stitching; an LED shift indicator and LED overhead lighting; and for EX and higher trims, a leather shift boot. 
The 2016 Civic Sedan offers customers more premium features than ever before. New standard equipment includes automatic climate control, auto-up/down front-power windows, an electronic parking brake with Brake Hold and Walk-Away auto door locks. Additional available premium features, depending upon trim, include heated side mirrors and remote engine start rain-sensing wipers (Touring), heated front seats (EXT and above) and heated outboard rear seats (Touring), an eight-way power driver's seat (EX-L and Touring), a four-way power front passenger's seat (Touring) and an adjustable driver's seat thigh support with 14 degrees of tilt. 
Civic Audio and ConnectivityCivic EX and higher trims come equipped with a new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen with a higher resolution Android-based operating system. The Civic joins the 2016 Accord as two of the first high-volume models to incorporate both the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms, providing seamless integration of smartphone features and functions. Smartphone connectivity for the Civic Sedan is now accomplished using a single USB cable connection.
The new Civic Sedan also delivers on the audio front with more powerful systems and expanded listening options, including SiriusXM Radio, Pandora compatibility and HD Radio. Civic LX trims feature a 160-watt, four-speaker sound system and 5-inch LCD screen for control of audio functions, while EX and EX-L trims feature a 180-watt system, eight-speaker system and utilize the new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen as the nerve center for audio and climate control. The new-line-topping Touring trim features a 450-watt, 10-speaker audio systemthe most powerful in its competitive setintegrated with Display Audio.
Finally, while all Civic models with Display Audio provide for smartphone-powered GPS navigation via the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms (with compatible smartphone and customer data plan), for customers who want an embedded navigation capability, the Civic EX-L Navi and Touring trims are equipped with an all-new Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System developed in cooperation with the experts at Garmin  offering more intuitive operation, improved graphics and enhanced mapping capabilities.
Civic Safety PerformanceThe 2016 Civic utilizes an advanced body structure  including a next generation Advanced Compatibility Body Structure (ACE), a high-strength steel floor and tailor-tempered, ultra-high-strength B-pillars and rear frame rails  to provide a high degree of occupant protection while minimizing weight and aiding fuel efficiency. The new body structure works in concert with advanced front-side and side curtain airbag technology, including SmartVent technology for the driver and front passenger side airbags.
Utilizing these systems in conjunction with the new Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies, the 2016 Civic Sedan targets the highest available U.S. safety ratings  an NCAP 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
Civic ManufacturingThe 2016 Civic Sedan marks the first time Honda's North American manufacturing operations have served as the global lead plant for a model like Civic, sold worldwide. Further, all 2016 Civic Sedans for the North American market are manufactured at the company's Alliston, Ontario, and Greensburg, Indiana, auto plants6. The two new engines for the 2016 Civics are manufactured at Honda engine plants in Anna, Ohio, and Alliston, Ontario, with the new turbo engine produced exclusively at the Anna Engine Plant. The two continuously variable automatic transmissions are being produced by Honda plants in Russells Point, Ohio, and Celaya, Mexico.

Compared to the current model, the 2016 Civic Sedan is nearly 2 inches wider and 1 inch lower with a 1.2-inch longer wheelbase, featuring a more compact and sporty front overhang; a longer, more aggressively sculpted hood and fastback-style tail.
The taut and tidy proportions of the new Civic Sedan are complemented and accentuated by refined design details, including sleek and swept-back bodylines, a sharp and aggressive face and bulging wheel arches. The new Civic's more premium character is also highlighted by its available LED exterior lighting, including standard LED running lights, distinctive C-shaped LED taillights and featuring LED headlights on the Touring trim.
Two All-New PowertrainsThe 2016 Civic Sedan features two all-new, more powerful and fuel-efficient engines: Civic Sedan LX and EX trims are powered by a 2.0-liter, port-injected DOHC i-VTEC inline four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 138 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,200 rpm4 (+15 HP and +9 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to either a six-speed manual (LX trim only) or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Civic Sedan EX-T, EX-L and Touring trims are powered by a 1.5-liter, direct-injected DOHC TURBO inline 4-cylinder engine producing 174 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 162 lb.-ft. of torque from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm5 (+31 HP and +33 lb.-ft. vs. 2015 Civic 1.8L) and mated to an all-new CVT with torque converter designed specifically to complement the turbocharged engine.
Both engines feature a wide array of friction-reducing design and engineering features that support both high performance and high fuel efficiency. These two ultra-efficient engines, married to the 2016 Civic Sedan's highly aerodynamic body, help to garner class-leading EPA fuel-economy ratings of 31/41/35 mpg (city/highway/combined) for models equipped with the 2.0-liter engine and CVT, 27/40/31 mpg for the 2.0L with manual transmission and 31/42/35 mpg for models equipped with the 1.5-liter TURBO.
Advanced and Sporty New Body and ChassisThe 2016 Civic sets a new standard for dynamic handling, steering, ride quality and cabin quietness in the compact class, courtesy of its all-new platform, featuring the most rigid and tightly sealed body and the most sophisticated chassis in Civic history. 
Advancing the sporty character of this all-new Civic is its more sporty driving position, with a 1-inch lower hip point compared to the outgoing model. The Civic's all-new platform design and lower floor and engine enable the lower hip point. The new Civic chassis features a redesigned strut front suspension and a new multi-link rear suspension mounted to an ultra-rigid rear subframe.
Torsional rigidity of the new body is improved by 25 percent aided in part by more intensive use of ultra-high-strength steel. Fifty-nine percent of the unit body is composed of high-strength steel, including 14 percent hot-stamp steel, an increase of one percent ultra-high-strength steel use in the previous model. Aerodynamic efficiency is improved by 12 percent to class-leading levels through detailed CFD modeling, wind tunnel testing and tuning, and from the use full underbody covers (a Civic first). 
Despite its larger size, the new Civic unit body is 68 pounds lighter than before, while new body-sealing techniques result in a 58 percent reduction in cabin air leaks. Class-leading cabin quietness is further improved by the use of premium noise-reducing features, including a flush-mounted acoustic glass windshield, a more tightly sealed engine compartment and triple-sealed doors.
To achieve the Civic development team's high targets for dynamic performance and refined ride quality, the new Civic Sedan utilizes hydraulic compliance bushings; a technology typically reserved for more expensive vehicles, aiding the isolation of road vibration. Additional new chassis technologies include variable gear-ratio steering, beefier front and rear stabilizer bars and standard four-wheel disc brakes, along with the application of new Agile Handling Assist brake-torque vectoring technology for more precise and agile cornering.
Spacious, Sophisticated and Advanced CabinThe new Civic interior is designed to offer the most comfortable, sophisticated and premium-feeling cabin in the compact class. An additional 3.2 cubic feet of interior space translates into the largest cabin in the compact segment with 1.2 inches of added rear-seat legroom versus the outgoing model. In front, new ultra-thin front roof pillars enable class-leading forward visibility. At the rear, trunk space has been increased by 2.6 cubic feet a configuration with a lower lift-over height, larger opening and wider and taller cargo area. Civic Sedan EX and higher trims will feature a 60/40 split and folding rear seat. All Civic Sedan models also feature a larger, reconfigurable new center console with up to 7.2 liters of secure storage space; approaching SUV levels of console utility.
The new Civic interior strikes a more premium tone with high-quality materials and high-contrast finishes. These include a new one-piece, soft-touch instrumental panel with molded stitching; more premium seat fabrics; a new full-color TFT center meter (EX and above trims); a center console with piano black finish and high-contrast silver bezel; door inserts with real stitching; an LED shift indicator and LED overhead lighting; and for EX and higher trims, a leather shift boot. 
The 2016 Civic Sedan offers customers more premium features than ever before. New standard equipment includes automatic climate control, auto-up/down front-power windows, an electronic parking brake with Brake Hold and Walk-Away auto door locks. Additional available premium features, depending upon trim, include heated side mirrors and remote engine start rain-sensing wipers (Touring), heated front seats (EXT and above) and heated outboard rear seats (Touring), an eight-way power driver's seat (EX-L and Touring), a four-way power front passenger's seat (Touring) and an adjustable driver's seat thigh support with 14 degrees of tilt. 
Civic Audio and ConnectivityCivic EX and higher trims come equipped with a new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen with a higher resolution Android-based operating system. The Civic joins the 2016 Accord as two of the first high-volume models to incorporate both the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms, providing seamless integration of smartphone features and functions. Smartphone connectivity for the Civic Sedan is now accomplished using a single USB cable connection.
The new Civic Sedan also delivers on the audio front with more powerful systems and expanded listening options, including SiriusXM Radio, Pandora compatibility and HD Radio. Civic LX trims feature a 160-watt, four-speaker sound system and 5-inch LCD screen for control of audio functions, while EX and EX-L trims feature a 180-watt system, eight-speaker system and utilize the new 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen as the nerve center for audio and climate control. The new-line-topping Touring trim features a 450-watt, 10-speaker audio systemthe most powerful in its competitive setintegrated with Display Audio.
Finally, while all Civic models with Display Audio provide for smartphone-powered GPS navigation via the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto platforms (with compatible smartphone and customer data plan), for customers who want an embedded navigation capability, the Civic EX-L Navi and Touring trims are equipped with an all-new Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System developed in cooperation with the experts at Garmin  offering more intuitive operation, improved graphics and enhanced mapping capabilities.
Civic Safety PerformanceThe 2016 Civic utilizes an advanced body structure  including a next generation Advanced Compatibility Body Structure (ACE), a high-strength steel floor and tailor-tempered, ultra-high-strength B-pillars and rear frame rails  to provide a high degree of occupant protection while minimizing weight and aiding fuel efficiency. The new body structure works in concert with advanced front-side and side curtain airbag technology, including SmartVent technology for the driver and front passenger side airbags.
Utilizing these systems in conjunction with the new Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies, the 2016 Civic Sedan targets the highest available U.S. safety ratings  an NCAP 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
