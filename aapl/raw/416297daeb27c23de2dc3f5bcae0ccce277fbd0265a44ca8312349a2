2015-11-02 DUBLIN, Nov. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/qjqngw/3axis_and_6axis) has announced the addition of the "3-Axis & 6-Axis eCompass Comparison - Technology and Cost Review" report to their offering.  Magnetometers are widely integrated in consumer applications. More and more devices will require a positioning system and magnetometers are essential for such a purpose. A CAGR of +8% in units is forecasted by Yole Developpement from 2015 to 2020.  In this report, 3-Axis & 6-Axis eCompasses from different suppliers and different generations are compared in term of technology choice, manufacturing process and cost. The main eCompass references have been extracted from a wide selection of smartphones and analyzed. Size and technology quickly evolve but the main players remain AKM and Yamaha, representing more than 80% of the market. Nevertheless, several products from other players have been analyzed as well. These players, like Aichi Steel, ALPS, Bosch, Everspin, Honeywell or MEMSIC use different technologies and could disrupt the market within the next years.  The report includes a description of eCompass technologies (Hall sensor, AMR, GMR, TMR, MI, Fluxgate) and a comprehensive supply chain evaluation for most of 3-Axis & 6-Axis eCompasses. All of this technologies are physically analyzed and compared in this report including new devices like the Yamaha YAS537 3-Axis eCompass found in the Samsung Galaxy S6.  Key Topics Covered:  1.
