2015-11-11 U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne met Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook as part of his push to make Britain a global center for financial technology. Osborne said they spoke extensively about Apple Pay, the technology that allows people to make payments through their mobile phone, in talks in London on Tuesday. I was thinking how extraordinary it was that you had a finance minister and the head of a tech company talking about the future of banking, Osborne told a conference organized by the Bank of England on Wednesday. I want the U.K. to be the global center of fintech. We will go out of our way to make that happen. Apple has it European headquarters in Ireland, where a 5,000-strong workforce carries out roles ranging from software development to accountancy. Speaking in Dublin Wednesday, Cook underscored his commitment to the country by announcing plans to add 1,000 jobs. European antitrust authorities are investigating whether Ireland afforded Apple state aid by allowing it toshelter profits from tax in return for maintaining jobs in the country. Osborne, who has led a push to diversify Britains financial services industry, reiterated his focus on once dismissed digital currencies which may now well play a big part in our financial future. He also said the U.K. is committed to ensuring that regulators dont stifle innovation.
