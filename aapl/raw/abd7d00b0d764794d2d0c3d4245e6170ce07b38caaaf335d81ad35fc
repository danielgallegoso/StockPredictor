2015-11-13 SAN FRANCISCO -- In an email sent to all Apple employees,CEO Tim Cook said it was "unacceptable" for three black teenagers to have been barred from entering an Apple Store in Australia. The incident, a video of which went viral earlier this week, was considered the latest example of the tech industry's diversity problem. In the video, three black teenagers -- reportedly from Sudan and Somalia -- were kept from entering a company store in Melbourne, reportedlydue to one employee'sfear that "they might steal something." After footage of the interaction appeared online, it spread quickly, and culminated in a message from Apple. "We apologize to the customers involved," the company said. Cook further addressed the incident in a companywideemail, which was obtained by BuzzFeed News and published Friday. Cooksaid he believes it was an isolated incident, but said the company would use it as an opportunity toretrainleaders at its stores across the world on how tobe inclusive with customers of all backgrounds.  So these men who work @ the Apple Store, refused to let in Somali/Sudanese students in. Racially discriminating them pic.twitter.com/yomYNpSpCg 	&mdash; FD (@Crypticgirl_) November 10, 2015
