2015-11-11 Apple Inc. laid out plans to expand in Ireland, even as the company braced for a European ruling on its tax arrangements with the government. Apple will add a new building at its campus in Cork, in the south of Ireland, with space for 1,000 extra workers by the middle of 2017, the countrys inward investment agency said on Wednesday. Apple will always be proud to call Ireland home, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a speech at Trinity College in Dublin. Apple, which has operated in Ireland since 1980, employs more than 5,000 people in the country. European antitrust officials are probing the companys tax dealings in Ireland, with Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan saying a ruling will probably be made after Christmas. While Noonan said a year ago he thought it likely that the state aid investigation would be dropped, he told reporters in Dublin Wednesday he didnt know if the decision would go against Ireland. While its easier to have forceful views years out from a decision, with a finding only weeks away, he didnt want to prejudge the case, Noonan said. Apple has said in the past it doesnt use tax gimmicks, and the Irish government has indicated that itll fight an adverse decision in the European Union Court of Justice.
