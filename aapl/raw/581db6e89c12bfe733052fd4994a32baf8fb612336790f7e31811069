2015-10-21 Its been over six months since the launch of the Apple Watch and to put it mildly, Apple hasnt been too open with its sales figures. We are not announcing the numbers, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a session at the Wall Street Journal Digital Live Conference. That being said, Wall Street is still throwing out their best guesses for Apple's fiscalfourth-quarter sales, with estimates wildly ranging between 2.5 million and 6 million units, according to analysts polled by Fortune. The company's fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. Among the lowest of the estimates was one from Piper Jaffray senior research analyst Gene Munster, who pegged sales of the smartwatch at 2.5 million units. At the higher end of estimates was one from Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley, who estimated fourth-quarter watch sales at 5 million units, according to a research note released Wednesday. While we believe our initial Apple Watch expectations of 15 million units in 2015 are modest and represent only 3 percent of the iPhone installed base exiting 2015, we believe the Apple Watch will prove successful and enable Apple to dominate sales of this premium wearable category longer-term, he wrote in the note. As for how their estimates compare to Apple sales, Cook only offered this remark during the Wall Street Journal Conference: This is competitive information. I dont want to help the competition. We shipped a lot [of watches] in the first quarter, then the last quarter we shipped even more. When it comes to competition, Apple is facing off against a slew of Android Wear smartwatches from Huawei, LG, Motorola and Tag Heuer. And with the addition of iOS compatibility to Android Wear, iPhone users can now wear an Android smartwatch without needing to switch to an Android smartphone as well. Apple is expected to release its fourth fiscal quarter earnings on Oct. 27 after market close, followed by a conference call at 2 p.m. PDT.
