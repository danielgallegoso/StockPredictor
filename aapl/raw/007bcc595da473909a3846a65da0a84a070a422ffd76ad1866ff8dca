2015-10-18 Taylor Swift, the 25-year-old singer behind Shake It Off and Bad Blood, has become the highest-earning artist in the music world in 2015, according to the Sunday Express. To date, her income this year totaled $317.8 million, over a million dollars per day. That included income from her 1989 album, world music tour and endorsement deals with Coca-Cola and Elizabeth Arden. Swifts 1989 tour may be a large contributor to that total, with an overall gross income of $173 million from 59 concerts in North America, Asia and Europe, according to Billboard. Ticket sales from three venues in North America accounted for $13.6 million in ticket sales. Right now, Taylor is untouchable, media analyst Mike Raia told the Express. She is so far ahead of everyone else in the industry that she has become not only a powerhouse entertainer but also an important mover and shaker on the commercial side of the music business. Swift in 2015 also ranked the eighth-highest on Forbes Celebrity 100 and 64th on its list of most powerful women. On musics business side, she has also proved to be an influential figure in the streaming-music business. In June, Swift issued an open letter to Apple, weeks before it was set to launch its Apple Music streaming service. She wrote the letter in protest of reports that Apple wouldnt be paying royalties to the musicians and songwriters during the services three-month free trial period. In response to the letter, Apple quickly reversed its position on paying royalties during the free period. We hear you @taylorswift13 and indie artists.
