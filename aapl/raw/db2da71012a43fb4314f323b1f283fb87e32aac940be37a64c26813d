EXPERT ALERTS MEDIA JOBS OTHER NEWS & RESOURCES EXPERT ALERTS: EU Court Decision Tough for FCPA ProbesThomas FoxFCPA and Compliance Ethics Lawyer and AuthorAdvanced Compliance Solutions, HoustonThe recent decision by the European Union's top court to prevent the transatlantic transfer of European citizens' private data has sent shock waves through the data-gathering industry. The European Court of Justice threw out the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement because it allowed U.S. authorities to gain routine access to Europeans' online information. Says Fox: "That decision isn't just a problem for Google and Apple. It also has major implications for U.S. companies internally investigating business corruption in their European offices. For example, if a U.S. company is attempting to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice by investigating an employee in Europe, then the company is barred from providing the employee's emails without first getting their permission. What do you think the level of cooperation will be from an employee suspected of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act? It will take a while for U.S. officials to figure out how to navigate this."Contact: Kit Frieden, kit@androvett.com Solar Desalination Can Shape Our Water FutureAaron MandellChairmanHydroRevolution"We can shape the future when it comes to water.

While the film scored some direct hits -- wearable technology, video calls, fingerprint recognition -- some predictions fell well wide of the mark, though with driverless cars on the horizon, can flying cars be that far behind? Says Kimlinger: "We've seen remarkable advances in our field in the past couple of decades, from our understanding of the way our minds work to a greater awareness and sensitivity to various psychological conditions. But given the accelerated pace of change in all walks of life, from medicine to astrophysics, we can expect to see a lot of change in the field of behavioral health in just the next 12-18 months, let alone the next 5-10 years, driven largely by technology, from remote counseling to improved self-diagnosis via smarter mobile apps."MINES and Associates, a business psychology firm, has published a list of the most significant advances in behavioral and mental health over the past 30 years -- from landmark legislation to groundbreaking research -- and has begun compiling a list of predictions for changes in the field over just the next five years.Contact: Charles Epstein, che@backboneinc.com **************** MEDIA JOBS: Following are links to job listings for staff and freelance writers, editors and producers.
