2015-10-26 Apple is facing a $5 millionclass-action lawsuit over a feature in iOS 9 that uses mobile data even while the device is connected to a wireless router. Wi-Fi Assist, as the feature is called, is enabled by default when customers update to Apples latest mobile operating system. The plaintiffs of the suit, William Scott Phillips and Suzanne Schmidt Phillips, argue that Apple failed to properly explain the feature at launch, according to Apple Insider. After updating to iOS 9 on their iPhone 5S devices, the couple received data-overage charges from their wireless service provider. Wi-Fi Assist's purpose isto help customers stay connected to the Internet even when a Wi-Fi signal is poor, according to Apples support page. It also warns customers that the feature may use more cellular data but in most cases having it enabled shouldnt boost data usage more than afew percentage points. However, that updated guide came on Oct. 2, after a slew of user comments on the Web attributing higher data usage to the feature, according to the Washington Post. Despite the updated guide, the plantiffs allege that the iPhone maker downplays the possibility of data overages. The new &quot;WiFi Assist&quot; feature on iOS 9 just ate through my data plan. iPhone users, beware. Switching it off is a better option. 	&mdash; J.M.
