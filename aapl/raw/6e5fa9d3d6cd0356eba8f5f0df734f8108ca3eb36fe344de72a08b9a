Lobbying disclosure reports filed Tuesday with the Clerk of the House of Representatives showed that in addition to Google eight other companies tracked by the nonpartisan, nonprofit public interest group trimmed their spending. Oracle, however, doubled down, increasing its lobbying expenditures 101 percent to a record $2.48 million in the third quarter of 2015, up from $1.20 million in 2014, the disclosure records showed. Amazon posted a substantial gain as well, increasing its lobbying spending 71 percent to $2.02 million in the third quarter of 2015. It had spent $1.18 million on lobbying in the third quarter of 2014. "Even with cutbacks by some firms the lobbying figures once again demonstrate how our democracy has been hijacked by corporate interests," said John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog's Privacy Project director. "Washington is all about the money." Facebook spent $2.59 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of 6 percent compared to $2.45 million in 2014.
