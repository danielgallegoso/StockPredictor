2015-10-29 Samsungs 18.4-inch display clad tablet Galaxy View has become official. Samsung Tomorrow describes this device as the largest Android mobile device on the market. The key features of this slate reportedly include a gigantic touch screen, video-focused user interface and a king-sized battery to keep the device powered-on for a longer period of time. To top it all off, the Galaxy View tablet apparently allows users to view content from TV and other forms of service. Spec-wise, the Samsung Galaxy View weighs 2.65 kilograms(5.8 pounds) and it is 11.9 mm thick. The backside of the slate has a versatile two-way stand to make sure the device doesnt slide out. The Galaxy View tablets 5,700 mAh battery cell is reportedly capable of providing up to 8 hours of non-stop video playback. To magnify the audio experience, media content can be listened via the dual 4W stereo speaker setup, GSM Arena reported.

The View comes equipped with either 32 GB or 64 GB of expandable storage with the help of a microSD card slot. A 2.1-megapixelfront-facing camera unit helps with video conferencing or chats.

Giving the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow a miss, Samsung has apparently settled for Android 5.1 Lollipop OS with a Media UX skin. Even though, the Galaxy View price is not official at this point, Adorama briefly listed the device for$599. What do you think of the Galaxy View? Can this compete with 2-in-1 devices like the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and Apple iPad Pro? Feel free to leave a comment.
