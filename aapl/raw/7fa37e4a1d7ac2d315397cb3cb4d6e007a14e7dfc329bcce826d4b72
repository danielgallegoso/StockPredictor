2015-10-15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdg7iEiXQAg    Apple unveiled a new ad for the iPhone 6s. It follows the same vein as the previous ads, saying "the only thing that's changed is everything." This time, the company focuses on 3D Touch, one of the most important new features in the iPhone 6s.    It takes the time to explain how the peek and pop gestures work. You light press to peek at some information, and you press a bit harder to load the actual content. Apple shows these interactions in Apple apps, such as Mail, Maps and Messages, as well as third-party apps, such as Instagram.    As a reminder, 3D Touch is a completely different software implementation of the technology that is already available on the Apple Watch and the new MacBook trackpad and called Force Touch. It adds another set of gestures to let you do things faster and I said it will change the way we interact with our phones.    I still agree with this statement as my usage of my favorite apps has changed over time, starting with Tweetbot, which just added 3D Touch support. Our own John Biggs agrees with me, calling 3D Touch Apple's secret weapon.    And yet, it is hard to explain how 3D Touch works. The best way to understand it is to try it on an iPhone 6s. But maybe you don't live next to an Apple Store. That's why today's ad feels more like a how-to video.    With 30 seconds, you can't tell everything, so there are a few 3D Touch interactions not in the video, starting with home screen shortcuts, live photos, live wallpapers or my personal favorite feature, the touchpad:    https://twitter.com/panzer/status/646424443405729792
