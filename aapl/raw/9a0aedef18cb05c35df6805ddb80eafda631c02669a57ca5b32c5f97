2015-10-20 LGs Nexus 5X is the smaller of the two Nexus lineup unveiled recently. While this handset comes with a non-removable Li-Po 2,700 mAh battery unit, the bigger sibling Huawei Nexus 6P flaunts a relatively huge, non-removable Li-Po 3,450 mAh cell. Here, readers can find out which device out of the two stands out with regard to battery life. Spec-wise, the Nexus 5X features a handy 5.2-inch display and 1,080 x 1,920 pixels Full HD screen resolution, whereas the Nexus 6P comes with a 5.7-inch display and 1,440 x 2,560 pixels QHD resolution.The smaller sibling comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection, while the jumbo sibling sports the latest Glass 4. Both the handsets have a fingerprint scanner at the back and USB Type C port for charging. Moving on to the battery test, Phone Arena has made both the devices go through custom test. The phones are set to same conditions:screen brightness at 200 nits and the site reportedly runs a script that will replicate the real-life usage on the smartphones. To top it off, the display is kept "on"all throughout the custom test. The Nexus 5X apparently amassed "6 hours and 25 minutes" in the aforesaid test. Phone Arena said thatthis is an average score for a flagship. Notably, both Samsung Galaxy S6 with "7 hours and 14 minutes" and Apple iPhone 6s with "8 hours and 15 minutes" trumped the Nexus device fair and square. The Nexus 6P, on the other hand, reportedly scored "6 hours and 24 minutes," even with a bigger battery capacity. In this category, the 6P got beaten by Apple iPhone 6s Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 5 with the same score of "9 hours and 11 minutes." Readers should note thatGoogles Android 6.0 Marshmallow comes packed with a new technology called "Doze." This is a battery life saving mechanism where the handsets stand-by time improves tremendously by reducing the background processes during the devices idle time. However, in Phone Arenas custom test, stand-by time has not been accounted.
