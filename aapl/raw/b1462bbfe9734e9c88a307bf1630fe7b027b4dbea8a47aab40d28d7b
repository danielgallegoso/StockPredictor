2015-10-27 Apple Inc. (Nasdaq:AAPL) turned in another huge quarter, with profits surging more than 30 percent,driven by global sales of the iPhone 6 and 6S. Despitefears that the Chinese stock market crashwould cool their love of all things Apple, sales in that countrywere up 99 percent from the comparable period last year. Apple posted earnings of $11.1billion on $51.5billionrevenue, or $1.96per share, beatinganalyst projectionsof $10.7 billion on $51.1 billion in revenue. That compares with$8.5 billion in profit on $42.1 billion in revenue last year. Earnings per share were up 54cents during the same period. Fiscal 2015 was Apples most successful year ever, with revenue growing 28 percentto nearly $234 billion. This continued success is the result of our commitment to making the best, most innovative products on earth, and its a testament to the tremendous execution by our teams, Apple CEO Tim Cook saidin a statement. We are heading into the holidays with our strongest product lineup yet, including iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, Apple Watch with an expanded lineup of cases and bands, the new iPad Pro and the all-new Apple TV, which begins shipping this week. Apples iPhone accounted for most of its revenue, with48 million units sold, up 22percent from 39.3 million during the same period last year. The smartphone came in withinanalyst expectations of 48 to49 million units for the period. But analysts are looking to the all-important holiday quarter, whenApple sold 74.5 million iPhones last year.  Theres a lot of skeptics about what growth could be with the 6S, Daniel Ives, senior analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said. But the main headwind has been around China because so much of the growth is tied to China for Apple. The U.S. is still Apples largest revenue market, but China has followed closely behind with $12.5 billionin revenue, up 99percent from $6.3billion in the prioryear. IPhone sales were up 120 percent, Cook said during Apple's conference call. The Apple Watch remains a point of mystery for the company, since it hasn't revealed any specifics on sales since the smartwatch's launch in April. Further obscuring its sales is the addition of a number of new services to Apples wheelhouse, including the Apple Music subscription service and the Apple Pay mobile wallet service. The enterprise market is also a growing revenue area for Apple, accounting for $25 billion this year, up 40 percent from last year.In 2015, Apple has pursued a number of business customers through its partnerships with IBM and Cisco. The Mac saw sales come in at 5.7million units, up 3percent from the 5.5million sold last year. As expected, the iPad continued its decline, with 9.9million units sold, down 20percent from 12.3million units sold in 2014. Apple is hoping to soften the iPads unit sales decline with the higher-priced iPad Pro, set to launch in November. "Nobody is asking about iPad on the call," said Cook during the results conference call.  Apples fiscal 2015 fourth-quarter guidance places revenue from$75.5billion to $77.5billion and gross margins between 39percent and 40 percent. It's a conservative estimate compared with the $74.6 billion in revenue it pulled in during the December quarter last year.The next dividend of 52cents a share will be payable Nov. 12 to shareholders of record by the close of business Nov. 9.
