The announcementis Apples second green initiative in sixmonths as the company seeks to repair its image after harsh criticismoverpollution from the company's Chinese supply chain. Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, and the time for action is now, AppleCEO Tim Cook said in Beijing. Apple said in April that it would buildtwo 20 megawatts solar farms in Sichuan province, which is now complete, creating more than the total amount of electricity used by Apples offices and retail stores in China. As part of Wednesday's announcement, Apples largest Chinese supplier, Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd., said that it will build 400 megawatts of solar energy projects by 2018, starting in Henan province. Foxconn has committed to generate as much renewable energy as its Zhengzhou factory uses in final production of the iPhone, Apple said. The program will avoid over 20 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions in China between now and 2020 and willsignificantly expand the companys clean-energy investments in China. The new projects will collectively amount toa total of 2 gigawatts worth of solar power installations for Apple's Chinese factories, according to a company statement. According to Reuters,the iPhone maker said it would buy about $850 million worth of power from a solar farm to cut its energy bill in its home state of California in February. Other Silicon Valley giants are also moving into renewable energy, including Google, which announced a new wind power investment in Kenya this week.
