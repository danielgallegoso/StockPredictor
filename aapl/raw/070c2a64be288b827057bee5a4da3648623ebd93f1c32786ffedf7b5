The OnePlus X was launched in London on Thursday morning and will go on sale through the same inviteprocess in whichthe original OnePlus One and its successor, the OnePlus 2, were sold. The company has come under significant pressure from customers in recent months for failing to fulfill orders in a timely manner, but clearly the company believes this is the best way of processing sales. The OnePlus X will cost $100 less than the company's flagship model, and the $249 price tag will make it a very attractive proposition for those looking to buy a phone outright. The company is pushing the design of the new smartphone, calling it a "work of art" in the press release accompanying the launch. The phone is ultraslim at 6.9 mm, which is slightly thinner than the 7.1 mm iPhone 6S, and at just 138 grams, itis also slightly lighter than Apple's latest smartphone, which weighs143 grams. The phone is available in two finishes:theOnyxversion, featuring a black glass finish combined with a metallic frame, andthe more exclusive versionwitha ceramic finish; the lattertakes 25 days to create andthere will be only10,000 of themavailable at a premium -- andit won't go on sale in the U.S.
