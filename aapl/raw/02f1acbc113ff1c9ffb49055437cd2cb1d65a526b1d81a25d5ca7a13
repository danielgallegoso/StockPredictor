Recently, Life & Style magazine reported, citing a source,that Shelton and Stefani are talking about a wedding less than four months after each of their marriages imploded. Blake would marry Gwen today if he could, the source told the magazine, adding that NBC would be thrilled if he proposed on the air. Its more than a hookup, the source said, adding that the two are planning an upcoming tropical getaway, where Shelton will propose to Stefani. However, Gossip Cop slammed the reports, saying that the two have not been planning a wedding. Despite months of speculation over Stefani and Sheltons alleged relationship, the pair has not directly addressed the rumors. Last week, Shelton fired back on Twitterat rumors about his personal life. The 39-year-old country singer also has been concentrating on his appearance and career since his divorce. He has been showing off a thinner frame and, in an interview last month, said his skinnier physique is a result of what he calls the "divorce diet."
