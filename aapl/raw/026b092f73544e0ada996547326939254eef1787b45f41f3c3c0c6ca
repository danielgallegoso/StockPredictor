2015-10-29 As if unlimited music streaming wasnt enough, T-Mobile may extend its all you can eat data usage model to video services. According to tech leaker Evan Blass, the carriers next big perk will be the ability to stream video from apps such as Netflix and HBO without it counting against customers data plans. T-Mobile already does this through its Music Freedom feature, which lets customers stream unlimited music from music services such as Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play Music. But for video services, the unlimited streaming deal could come with a catch. A second tweet from Blass noted that itmay only apply to video streamed through its slower 4G network. T-Mobile&#39;s Uncarrier 10 to offer unlimited high speed data for watching select streaming video services like Netflix, HBO, etc. 	&mdash; Evan Blass (@evleaks) October 29, 2015 Speaking w someone else, this seems to actually just allow unlimited video on 4G without making you churn through LTE data first. 	&mdash; Evan Blass (@evleaks) October 29, 2015 Netflix and HBO are the only services mentioned in his Tweets. But if T-Mobile follows a similar path as its Music Freedom service, its possible that additional services, such as YouTube, may also be included. T-Mobile is expected to officially unveil the unlimited video streaming deal on Nov. 10, when it is scheduled to host its Uncarrier 10 media event. The carriers rumored move into unlimited video comes months after Verizon launched its own Go90 video service, which lets smartphone owners watch streaming television shows, music and sports. While the service is available for U.S. smartphone users, some of the content is exclusive to Verizon customers.
