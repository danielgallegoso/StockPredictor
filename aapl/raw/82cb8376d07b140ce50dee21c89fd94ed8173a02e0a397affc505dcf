2015-11-06 MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich., Nov. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The BetterInvesting Top 100 Index (BIXX), reflecting the portfolios of Main Street investors, gained 7.5% in October and increased by 14.3 percent annually for the previous five years, versus a 7.3% monthly increase and annual growth of 14.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 Equal-Weight Index (based on a total return for both indexes in which dividends are reinvested).  BIXX's total return index ended October at 335.36, compared with 312.05 at the end of September. The 7.5% increase in October followed a 2.7% decline in September and 6.3% drop in August. Without dividends reinvested, the index was 261.32 at the end of October, up 12.1 percent over five years.  The BetterInvesting Top 100 Index comprises the most popular holdings of investment clubs, employing annual data from the myICLUB.com online club accounting program. Solactive calculates the index, which began on April 9, 2007, at a base value of 150. BIXX is equal-weighted, meaning that each component constitutes the same percentage in the index. BIXX reflects actual portfolio decisions by individual investors in investment clubs, while other indexes are weighted heavily toward decisions by large institutional investors. BetterInvesting's individual members and investment clubs tend to have a longer-term focus than do institutions, with clubs' average holding period for stocks at 3.0 years in 2014, according to myICLUB.com data.  Holding quality stocks selling at reasonable prices for the long term allows clubs and individual investors to benefit from the return these stocks often earn when the market recognizes their excellence. Long-term investing also reduces the costs of trading, which effectively increases return. In October, the most common stocks acquired by investment clubs that subscribe to myICLUB, in terms of number of clubs buying, were: BIXX includes companies of all sizes, from small and medium-size firms to the world's largest companies.
