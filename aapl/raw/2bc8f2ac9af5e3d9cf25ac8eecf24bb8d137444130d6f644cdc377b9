2015-10-30 As if you need another excuse to chow down on sweets on Halloween, Saturday is National Caramel Apple Day! Caramel apples are truly a fall treat, but they definitely arent the healthiest snack around. Apples typically have 77 to 120 calories, depending on size, and provide 2 to 4 grams of fiber, calcium, vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, magnesium and other minerals, according to livestrong.com. However, that thick, delicious coating is what makes caramel apples a sugary splurge. The caramel adds about 120 to 160 calories to the apple, bringing the total calorie count to around 200 to 280 calories --as much as a candy bar. On National Caramel Day, though, theres no need to count calories! Be adventurous and break away from the traditional, classic caramel apple with a creative recipe.
