Our Q3 results show the strength of Google's business, particularly in mobile search. With six products now having more than 1 billion users globally, we're excited about the opportunities ahead of Google, and across Alphabet, Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google, said in a statement. Those six products are Search, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Android and, most recently, Google Play, said Google CEO Sundar Pichai.The third quarter was an impressive period across the board for Alphabet, saidJohnny Won, founder of Hyperstop, a consultancy firm."There is growth in virtually every category and even though cost-per-click continues to go downward, there seems to be robust revenue growth especially around mobile search," Won said. Additionally, Pichai announced that Google has now indexed more than 100 billion deep links from third-party apps, which means that users now see numerous results from mobile apps, not just websites, when they enter a query into Google."This keeps Google in the position of power since its what users want but its also a reminder that Apple is doing nearly the same thing in iOS 9 without using Google at all," Won said. "Deep linking has just begun for mobile search queries, but its unclear how Google will be as relevant on Apples iOS as it is on desktop."
