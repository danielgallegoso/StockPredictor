2015-10-30     Outside of the deals they give students and the occasional Black Friday hook up, Apple isn't exactly known for throwing around discounts.    So here's a wild one: Apple is experimenting with giving people $50 discounts on Apple Watches if they buy one at the same time as a new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus.    MacRumors has the scoop, but here's what you need to know     They're only running the promo in a handful of stores in California (Burlingame, Chestnut Street, Corte Madera, Hillsdale, SF, Stonestown) and Massachusetts (Boylston Street, Burlington, Cambridge Side, Chestnut Hill)  not online. If in doubt, call ahead before you make the drive to an Apple Store.   The deal only applies if you're buying an iPhone and an Apple Watch at the same time  not if you already own an iPhone. (Though if you bought that iPhone sometime in the last 14 days, you're within the return window and can probably work something out.)   The high end Apple Watches  Edition and Herms  aren't a part of the promotion    The promo runs from October 30 to November 15.    Why might they do this?For one, it's all about getting new people to dive head first into Apple's ecosystem.    Getting a phone in your pocket is one thing; they make some money on the margin, and then more over time with things like iCloud and app purchases.But if they can get a watch on your wrist at the same time (which is more likely when the buyer feels like they're getting a special deal), you're like the perfect customer  and one that's probably not leaving Apple's ecosystem any time soon.        If you get used to an Apple Watch; you can't switch to an Android phone without also switching to Android Wear at the same time  increasing both the cost and effort required to abandon ship. Meanwhile, your wrist, unlike your phone, is visible at almost all times; you're now a dedicated customer and a walking billboard.    That's worth a whole lot more than the $50 they're eating here.
