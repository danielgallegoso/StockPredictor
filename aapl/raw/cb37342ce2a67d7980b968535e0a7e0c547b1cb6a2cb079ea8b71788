According to the credible Taiwanese publication DigiTimes, less than 2.5 million units of the Apple iPad Pro has been ordered from the suppliers for the rest of 2015. Sadly, this number is expected to be even lesser for the first quarter of 2016, depending on the slates sales in the upcoming holiday season. The pricing of the Apple iPad Pro is believed to be the possible reason for the subdued expectations. The 12.9-inch slate will reportedly set the buyers back by $799 for the 32 GB model. A 128 GB variant, on the other hand, has been quoted to cost a whopping $949. In casea buyer would like to go for the optional Smart Keyboard and the Pencil aka Stylus, the device bundle will cost an arm and a leg at around $1200. To break it down, the keyboard and pencil cost $169 and $99, respectively. In the meantime, if a buyer wants a Wi-Fi + LTE version, the tablet will cost $130 more than the Wi-Fi only model, GSM Arena reported. This means, the high-end version will come for $1,079. The iPad Pro features Apples latest A9X chip, 64- bit architecture and M9 motion co-processor, along with iOS 9, Touch ID fingerprint scanner and Apple Pay support.
