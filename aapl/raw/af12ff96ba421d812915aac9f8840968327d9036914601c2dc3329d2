2015-11-09 Apple is mum on the release date of the iPad Pro, but retailers in the U.S. such as Sams Club and MacMall have already started with its preorders. Fresh rumors suggest that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be releasing on Nov. 13. Previous leaks had claimed that the iPad Pro would be releasing on Nov 11. However, Cult of Mac has reported that the large-sized iPad would be releasing on the coming Friday, Nov. 13. It has further stated that since Apple usually makes its new products available for purchase from Friday, the iPad Pro seems all the more poised to release on Nov. 13. Even though there is no information on whether the Apple Pencil would be also available from Nov. 13, the publication added that it likely that the Cupertino company would also make the stylus available alongside the iPad Pro. According to Phone Arena, companies avoid releasing its products on Nov. 11 in the U.S. as it is the Veterans Day in the country. Hence, the Cupertino company is likely to release the iPad Pro on Nov. 13.
