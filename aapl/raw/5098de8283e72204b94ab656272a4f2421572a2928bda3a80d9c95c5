2015-11-11 NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Baron Fig, the New York City startup famous for their analog notebook Kickstarter in 2013, launched a new campaignyesterday to fund a pen, which they're calling The Squire.

Last time they hit their goal on day one, which was an impressive feat, especially given the non-mainstream capacity of Kickstarter at the time. Yesterday they hit their goal in just 5 hours, and at the end of day one they'd tripled their asking goal with no slowdown in sight. The Squire was named Kickstarter Staff Pick, just like the Confidant notebook from their previous campaign. The pen is a beautifully designed, ultra minimal pen. It is precision weighted, made from a solid block of aluminum, and comes in silver and charcoal. Their Kickstarter page reads, "Every notebook needs a sword by which thoughts cut sharp, the tool of ideation: a well-designed pen." Mike Thompson, one of the current 565 backers, commented on the project, saying, "I've been using the Confidant and Apprentice for over a year now and they are awesome! As a self-described pen addict, [backing the Squire] was an easy decision to make." Baron Fig is the company that has thrived for over two years, despite the naysayers, providing well-designed quality analog tools to thinkers around the world. We may be living in "The Digital Age," but this playful group is proving there's still a place for analog.
