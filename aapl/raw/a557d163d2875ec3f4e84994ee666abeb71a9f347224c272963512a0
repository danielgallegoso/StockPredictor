At the end of September, only14 percent of American households with credit cards had signed up for the service, up only three percentage points since February and indicating slowing growth for the payment option. The figures were reportedby Phoenix Marketing International, a marketing consulting firm, at a payments conference in Las Vegas."A very rapid initial threshold was achieved by Apple Pay, and it is still growing but the growth rate has slowed down," said Greg Weed, Phoenix Marketing's director of card performance research,Reutersreported. Apple Pay is in a crowded market with many players, including Google's Android Pay, Samsung Pay and, soon, a new challenger from JP Morgan Chase. The marketing firm's research also found that among Apple Pay users, 86 percent signed up with credit cards while 49 percent use debit cards and 22 percent use other types of prepaid cards. Phoenix Marketing has been tracking Apple Pay since the service's launch a year ago by following a group of 15,000 consumers, Reuters said.
