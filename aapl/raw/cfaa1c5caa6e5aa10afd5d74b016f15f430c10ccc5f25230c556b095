 At launch, the Galaxy Note 5 was only available in black sapphire and white pearl color options. However, Samsung is also expected to bring gold platinum and silver titanium color options to other markets in the coming months.Samsung officially unveiled the Galaxy Note 5 on Aug. 13, followed by U.S. sales on Aug. 21. The handset also went on sale in India on Sept. 20 and is expected to arrive in Europe by January. While Samsung is the largest smartphone maker in the world, its expected to post its first negative decline in shipments in 2015. According to figures released by TrendForce, the Galaxy maker is expected to see annual shipments fall 1 percent, down to 323.5 million units. That comes as Samsung faces increased pressure from both Apple and Chinese domestic smartphone makers, such as Huawei, Xiaomi and Lenovo. On the flipside, Samsung revised its earnings guidance on Oct. 7, with a forecasted 80 percent climb operating profit. But thats expected to come not from smartphone sales. Instead the profit jump is expected to come from a weaker South Korean Won.
