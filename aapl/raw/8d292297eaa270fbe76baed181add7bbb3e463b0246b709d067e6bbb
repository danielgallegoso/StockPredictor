2015-11-10 AYER, Mass., Nov. 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Whether gearing up for Thanksgiving, prepping for the holidays, or even thinking ahead to New Year's entertaining, schedules are packed and time to bake and cook is limited. Instead of turning to the usual premade or store bought appetizers and desserts this holiday season, Nasoya, the country's leading maker of pre-made refrigerated wraps, encourages savvy home cooks to use its product to save time while still making their own inspirational dishes. In fact, Nasoya finds the holiday season through the New Year to be the busiest for sales of its Wonton and Egg Roll Wraps, typically seeing a 30% sales increase this time of year. "We attribute the increase in sales to the versatility of Nasoya Wraps," says Walt Riglian, CEO of Vitasoy-USA, "With the trend of speed scratch baking on the rise during the holiday season, Nasoya Wraps are the perfect solution for home cooks because they eliminate the tedious step of making your own wrap or pie crust, but still allow for a huge amount of creativity in the kitchen. Using the wraps can cut down on prep time without sacrificing great taste and variety in hundreds of recipes from appetizers to entrees to desserts." The possibilities are endless when it comes to using Nasoya Wraps for recipe creation; they are the perfect vehicle for making easy and delicious finger foods in minutes, with just a few short steps. Starting with a package of Egg Roll or Won Ton wraps, home cooks then simply fill, bake or fry the wrap, and in minutes, have the perfect small bite for everyday or entertaining. Most recipes can even be prepared ahead of time. Nasoya expects the following recipes to be popular on holiday menus this year and even more inspiration can be found on the brand's Pinterest page:  Nasoya Wraps are available at grocers nationwide and can be found in the refrigerated case in the produce section.
