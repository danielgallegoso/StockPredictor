2015-11-03 LOD, Israel, Nov.3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Third Quarter Highlights: Details: AudioCodes (Nasdaq: AUDC), a leading provider of converged voice solutions that enable enterprises and service providers to transition to all-IP voice networks, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were $34.2 million, compared to $32.4 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $38.9 million for the third quarter of 2014.  Net loss was $130,000, or ($0.00) per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2015, compared to a net loss of $708,000, or ($0.02) per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2014.  On a Non-GAAP basis, the Company reported a quarterly net income of $1.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income excludes: (i) stock-based compensation expenses; (ii) amortization expenses related to intangible assets; and (iii) non-cash deferred tax benefit or expenses. A reconciliation of net income (loss) on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis is provided in the tables that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this press release.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2015 totaled $1.8 million. Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and marketable securities were $75.3 million as of September 30, 2015 compared to $89.3 million as of September 30, 2014. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and marketable securities was the result of the use of cash for the continued repurchasing of the Company's ordinary shares pursuant to its share repurchase program. "We are pleased to report a return to growth in revenues and improved sequential financial performance for the third quarter of 2015," said Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of AudioCodes. "Third quarter revenues demonstrate strong performance across our networking business which grew 10.3% over the previous quarter. Driven by healthy demand in the unified communications market and the business communications services market, we saw increased traction in our sales and continued to solidify our position as a leading Voice Networking solutions and services vendor. Backed by the strong trend of network transformation into all-IP networks, our continued investment in the Microsoft Skype for Business ecosystem and our session border controller (SBC) activities provided more than 15% sequential growth in each of these market segments. As in previous quarters, we experienced growing collaboration with our industry partners, which we believe will support further growth in coming years." "As we remain focused on improving bottom line results, we made solid progress with our cost reduction plan announced in July 2015. Third quarter financial results reflect this reduction in operating expenses, an area we intend to continue to focus on in 2016 and beyond," concluded Mr. Adlersberg. Share Buy Back Program During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, AudioCodes acquired 1.1 million shares under the existing share repurchase program for a total consideration of approximately $3.7 million. As of September 30, 2015 and since beginning the repurchase of its shares in August 2014, AudioCodes had acquired an aggregate of 4.7 million shares for an aggregate consideration of approximately $20.3 million.  In August 2014, the Board of Directors of AudioCodes approved a program to repurchase up to $3 million of its ordinary shares. In addition, AudioCodes received court approvals in Israel in November 2014 and May 2015 to purchase up to an aggregate of $30 million of additional ordinary shares pursuant to this program. The current court approval for share repurchases will expire at the end of December 2015. At that time the authority to repurchase any unutilized portions of the prior approval will expire. On November 2, 2015 the Board of Directors has approved filing a new application with the court requesting approval for a new repurchase program for a total consideration of up to $10 million in share repurchases for a period of 6 months from the date of receipt of court approval.

The Company has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of operating results in a manner similar to how the Company analyzes its operating results and because many comparable companies report this type of information.

The Company has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of operating results in a manner similar to how the Company analyzes its operating results and because many comparable companies report this type of information.

The Company has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of operating results in a manner similar to how the Company analyzes its operating results and because many comparable companies report this type of information.

The Company has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of operating results in a manner similar to how the Company analyzes its operating results and because many comparable companies report this type of information.

	   $ 0.04  (1) Stock-based compensation expenses related to options and restricted stock units granted to employees and others.  (2) Amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions of Nuera, Netrake, and Mailvision assets.  (3) Non-cash deferred tax expenses. Note: Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of its ongoing economic performance and therefore uses internally this non-GAAP information to evaluate and manage its operations. The Company has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of operating results in a manner similar to how the Company analyzes its operating results and because many comparable companies report this type of information.
