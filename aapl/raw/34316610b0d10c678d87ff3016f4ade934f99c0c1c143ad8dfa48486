ForeFlight Mobile allows them to see the weather and route information that the pilots up front are seeing." John Wade, Gogo Business Aviation's executive vice president and general manager, said, "Using the ForeFlight Mobile app in conjunction with Gogo's ATG 1000 connectivity system gives aircraft operators a complete solution for passengers and pilots alike. We're proud to partner with ForeFlight on this important initiative that will bring increased utility to our customers' in-flight connectivity investment."
