2015-11-03 Tables have yet to be set and turkeys havent even made their way to grocery store shelves, but Sams Club is betting Americans will want to rush over to the warehouse store for deep discounts on Apples iPhone 6S. On Nov. 14, the Sams Club chain is offering customers a $200 Sams Club gift card with activation of an iPhone 6S under an installment payment plan with Verizon, AT&T or Sprint. Alternatively shoppers can go with a two-year contract through Sprint, Verizon Wireless or U.S. Cellular, which comes with a $100 savings over standard contract pricing. Under the subsidized plans, prices for the iPhone 6S start at $99 for the 16GB model, $199 for 64GB, and $299 for the 128GB version. Tack on $100 for the6S Plus with 5.5-inch display. The iPhone deals are only available in-store.
