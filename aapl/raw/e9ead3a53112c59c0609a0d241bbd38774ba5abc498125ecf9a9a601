2015-10-30 Samsungs new Exynos 8890 chipset is rumored to be part of the upcoming flagship Galaxy S7 and the curved-edge-display clad sibling Galaxy S7 Edge. A new report points to the production and release timeframe of the chipset and the devices. Come December, the power-packed Exynos 8890 SoC, also known as Exynos M1, will reportedly enter the mass production phase. This means, the Samsung Galaxy S7 release date could very well be sometime in January, Tech Times reported citing a Business Korea report. Notably, the company has apparently frozen the design of the upcoming devices back in September to meet the January deadline. As it turns out, the Exynos 8890 chipset is rumored to be power efficient, bundled with improved graphics performance, in order to take down counterparts from Qualcomm and Apple. The Exynos 8890 apparently works in tandem with an octa-core processor and it is believed to improve the battery performance tremendously. Another report also suggested thatthe South Korean tech giant might use both Exynos 8890 and Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipsets on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. The processor combination will apparently be decided based on the region of release. The current-generation high-end models like Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+ and Note 5 have been doing well as seen from the quarterly results posted by the South Korean tech giant very recently. The point to be noted however is thatSamsung has started seeing operating profits after almost 2 years of steady decline. The Verge, meanwhile, noted that Samsung saw substantial increase in sales from Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy Aand Galaxy J lineup of devices. Needless to say, the company will leave no stone unturned to get the formula right for the successors Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge to prolong the profit streak for the quarters to come. As always, readers should note thatSamsung has not confirmed any Galaxy S7-related details thus far.
