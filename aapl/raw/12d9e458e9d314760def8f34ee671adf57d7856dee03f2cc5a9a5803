2015-10-19 Ben Afflecks mother is helping the actor cope with his separation from Jennifer Garner, according to a report. Affleck and Garner announced in June they were divorcing, ending their 10-year marriage. "Ben's mum Christine is in full control of everything right now as he picks up the pieces from his broken marriage," a source told Britain's Grazia magazine, according to Xpose.ie. "Chris' boys, Casey and Ben, have always been the apple of her eye, ever since her husband left her. Ben's always been close to his mum, but he seems to have taken it to a whole new level since the split." The entertainment website stated that the Gone Girl actor is spending time with his mother and searching for locations for his new movie, Live By Night. Meanwhile, Garner, along with the former couples three children, has been staying at their family home in Los Angeles. The source told the magazine that Christine was concerned about Afflecks health. "Ben's in a pretty bad way," the insider said. "He's not really taking care of himself, he's not shaving, hardly washing and eating a lot of junk food and his mum can't bear to see him like this. She convinced him to stay in their family home so she could nurse him back to health. Now she's really pushing for him to move in full-time once he starts filming." Recently, the 43-year-old actor was spotted with his children and their new nanny, after an alleged affair with former nanny Christine Ouzounian. There were also reports that his estranged wife Garner was pregnant with their fourth child. However, Garners representative has dismissed the reports.
