2015-10-23 SANTA CRUZ, Calif., Oct. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Locally owned Lighthouse Bank (OTCQB: LGHT) today released unaudited financial results for the quarter-ended September 30, 2015. The Bank posted a $611 thousand profit for the period, as compared to $536 thousand during Q2 2015. Profit for the first nine months of 2015 was $1.64 million. This represented the 25th successive quarter of profitable operations for the eight-year-old Bank. For the period, total shareholders' equity grew by $503 thousand. Year-over-year, shareholders' equity increased $1.84 million, or 7%, to $26.9 million. Loans outstanding dropped slightly during the period due to construction loan payoffs, however new loan commitments increased by $10.6 million. Year-over-year loans increased $14 million, or 12%. Deposits increased $2.4 million during Q3 2015, ending at $148 million, up 8% year-over-year. Overall positive performance continued to be driven by the Bank's control of overhead expenses and consistent growth.  The Bank's loan loss reserve of 2.48% of gross loans remained significantly above the industry average for banks of all sizes. The Bank had no nonperforming loans, no nonperforming assets and no past due loans in excess of 30 days at period end. Lighthouse Bank has not taken a loan loss in over three years and has experienced only a single loan loss since opening in 2007.  During the 3rd quarter, the Bank continued the construction expansion of its future headquarters site at 2020 N. Pacific Avenue, Santa Cruz. The property, which was purchased by the Bank in January 2014, is located in the heart of downtown Santa Cruz. Full completion of the facility is anticipated by year-end with occupancy expected in Q1 2016. In addition, the Bank continued with expansion plans for its first branch location that will be situated in Silicon Valley. The location at 19240 Stevens Creek Blvd. in Cupertino, is adjacent to the new Main St. Cupertino Business Center and close to the 3.1 million sq. ft. Apple headquarters building now under construction. The Bank will take possession of the Stevens Creek Blvd. site in early 2016. The contiguous nature of the Silicon Valley market to that of Santa Cruz, staff experience working in that market, as well as community bank consolidations, have combined to provide a unique growth opportunity for Lighthouse Bank in Silicon Valley. In August 2015, the Bank paid a $0.075 per share regular quarterly cash dividend. In January 2015, the Bank paid a $.40 pershare special cash dividend to shareholders. This followed two prior stock dividends granted in 2011 and 2013. Since opening, Lighthouse Bank's consistently strong financial results continue to place it at the top of the industry in a variety of categories including asset quality, capital adequacy, return on equity and operational efficiency.
