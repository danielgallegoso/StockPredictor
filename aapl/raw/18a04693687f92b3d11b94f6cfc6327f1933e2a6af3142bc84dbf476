2015-10-29 LONDON -- Slimmer and lighter than an iPhone 6S witha larger, higher-resolution screen, the OnePlus X costs a fraction of the price of Apple's newest smartphone and could represent the best-value device on the market today. OnePlus is a Chinese startup that should be barely a blip inthe smartphone world. The company'sfirst smartphone sold 1.5 million units, a drop in the bucket when you consider that over350 million smartphones shipped in the last quarter alone, OnePlus would seem to merit little attention. But this company does things a little differently. By selling smartphones through an innovative (and highly frustrating) invite system,offeringlow prices and theboldclaims it makes about its devices, OnePlus is a company which offers something a little bitunusual in the smartphone world and has developed a fanatical fan base. Just a couple of months after it launched its "2016 flagship killer" -- the OnePlus 2 --the company is back with an even cheaper smartphone that promises to combine sleek, premiumdesign with a $249 price tag -- andit could be just about the best value on the market. People Want Smaller Phones At the launch of the new OnePlus smartphone in London, co-founder Carl Pei said one of the company's strengths is that it listens to its customers and communicates with them directly. Recently a lot of this communicationinvolved easinganger about delayed shipments of the OnePlus 2 and problems with the invite system, but Pei says the company also learnedthat customers wanted smallerdevices.  

 

The OnePlus X is described by the company as a "work of art" and it is hard to argue with them.

 And so we get the OnePlus X -- aslim,sleek smartphone with a 5-inch screen that's ultra-thin (6.9mm) and light (138g), a phone made withpremium materials like metal and glass -- something most budget smartphones simply don't offer. It is incredibly compact for a 5-inch smartphone, with its footprint only slightly larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 6S. Peipushedthe OnePlus X design very strong, calling it a work of art. The company launched two versions, the standard Onyxedition --which features a combination of glass and metal -- and an exclusive ceramic version that takes 25 days to make and will be available inlimited quantity of10,000. Design Why a ceramic phone? Very few companies would make one,Pei concedes, because of the production yield rate -- only one in five ends up being usable. But in this casethe strategy is to buildbrand awareness. The world has been"slowly losing interest in craftsmanship," says Pei, but "the OnePlus X brings back what happens when you bring back some of that pride in the creation of a product."  

 

The all metal and glass construction of the OnePlus is a world away from most budget smartphones.

 Pei asserts the extra time and money spent to create the Ceramic version was worth the end result, but in the time I had with the two versions, I found it difficult to see a clear difference and at times struggled to tell one from the other. That said, the black glass Onyx model is better than any smartphone I have used at this price point, and better thanmany that cost more. Itfeatures a metallic frame like the one on the iPhone 4, but with 17 micro-grooves etched into it all the way around, which makes it easier to hold.The screen is slightly curved and raised away from the edge,making swipingeasier. The look and feel is minimalism at its best, with the only thing breaking the pure black lines being the low-key OnePlus logo on the rear.Not that it's perfect.The rear cover is glass, so it picks up fingerprints very quickly, but I'm willing to overlook this slight negative given the overall design and build quality on display here. Screen OnePlus decided to go with AMOLED technology with the OnePlus X over the IPS tech in its previous two smartphones. While AMOLED allows for features like monochrome notifications on the lock screen to save battery life, there are some issues with oversaturation, and while blacks are really black, color reproduction is not quiteso natural.

 The 5-inch screen has Full HD resolution, the same as the 5.5-inch screen on the OnePlus 2. That adds up toa higher pixel resolution (441ppi vs. 400ppi),which suggeststhe screenis much sharper, though the difference is not immediately obvious. Overall the screen is great, and considering that most phones in this price bracket offer 720p displays rather than 1080p displays, this is certainly a cut above most of its competition. The Ambient Display feature, whichlets youactivate the screen to see notifications with the wave of a hand, is also a nice addition. Performance andBattery Life So far it all sounds too good tobe true, but one major concern is the One Plus X's useof thedatedSnapdragon 801 chipset from Qualcomm. This was released over 18 months ago, but the company says it still offers better results than Qualcomm's latest mid-range offering. To offset the older chipset, the OnePlus X does come witha hefty 3GB of RAM to boost performance and in the time I used the phone I found no problems with response time or navigating the interface.It will take more testing to really see how well it handles more intensive tasks like streaming video and 3D gaming. The performance is likely helped by the use of the companys own operating system, called Oxygen. It'sa relatively lightly-skinned version of Android offering lots of customization options. OnePlus has even added a throwback to older devices with the ability to listen to FM radio on the new phone without having to use up data -- particularly handy when traveling.  

 

One of the big questions to be answered is if the camera on the OnePlus X can live up to claims.

 The phone features a dual-SIM card setup that can also be used as a microSD card slot to expand the limited 16GB storage byup to another 128GB. This is vital considering there are no higher storage options.The phone comes with a relativity small 2525mAh battery, which OnePlus claims will give you all-day battery life, but this again will need to be tested fully before I would givea final verdict. Camera Therear camera on theOnePlus X, which sits flush with theback cover, comes with a 13 megapixel sensor and the company claims its phase detectionauto-focus system allows usersto focus in under 0.2 seconds. In the brief testing I carried out at the launch the camera did seem very responsive, though it struggled to produce sharp, clearimages in the dim surroundings of the central London tower where the phone debuted. The front-facing camera has an impressive 8-megapixel sensor on the front and with the few selfies I could manage to take, it produced very decent results.The OnePlus X also has the option to quickly launch the camera app by scribing a C on thedisplay -- even from the lock screen. Value Beyond the design, camera, batteryand processor, a key selling point for any smartphone in this section of the marketis price -- the OnePlus X's strong suit.For $249 you get a premium-feeling phone with a good screen and camera at a fraction of what you'd pay for a flagship model. The phone does feature a dated processor and limited storage, but the addition of a microSD card offsets the latter.  

 

The one design flaw with the OnePlus X is unavoidable on a glass-backed device -- fingerprints.

 Looking at the ever-increasing competition in this space, Motorola flanks the OnePlus X with the $180 Moto G, which offers a lower-resolution screen, and the Moto X Style, whichdelivers a bigger, higher-resolution screen but costs $400. HTC's Desire 626 again features a lower-resolution screen for $239. Fellow Chinese brand Alcatel's OneTouch Idol offers similar specs for the same price, but it can't match the OnePlus X in quality. The biggest challenger to the OnePlusX could of course come from the company itself, with the $329 OnePlus 2and itsbigger screen, fingerprint sensor, faster processor and the option of more built-instorage, but it is also more expensive and considerably bulkier. Availability The OnePlus X Onyx is available for preorder in Europe starting Nov. 5th, with the Ceramic version on presale starting Nov. 24th. U.S. dates have yet to be announced. Invites One of the reasons OnePlus has garnered so much media attention is down to its invite system for selling its smartphones. There's a waiting list, and buyers can also get an invite from a friendwho has purchased a One Plus device or through participating in social media campaigns. As well as generating buzz on social media, the system allows the company to manage its stock, though recent troubles with the OnePlus 2 have shown it still has some growing pains.  

 

To buy a OnePlus X you will first need a invite which can be obtained from social media, competitions or other OnePlus X owners.

 The company is continuing the system with the OnePlus X.It will be invite-only for the firstmonth beginning on Nov. 5, with open salesstarting inthe second month,initially lasting for hours and eventually growing to day-long sales. In a bid to offset any underlying mistrust following previous shortages,Pei saidOne Plushas already manufactured significant volumes of thenew smartphone and has warehouses fully loaded with OnePlus X already. Final Thoughts Smartphones recently have been getting bigger and bigger and putting them in your pocket comfortablyhas become a struggle. The OnePlus X directlyaddresses the market for people looking for a smaller smartphone and does so in style. I have rarely been as impressed with a smartphone as I was with the OnePlus X the first time I picked it up, and the use of premium materials and flawless build quality belies its $249 price. That said, I cannot recommend the phone unreservedly yet, as there are question marks over battery life, processor power and camera quality that will only be answered in a more in-depth review. But saying that, I am still highly impressed with OnePlus' latest effort. OnePlus X Specs:
