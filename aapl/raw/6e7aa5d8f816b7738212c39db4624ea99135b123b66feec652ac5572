2015-10-26 Before the earnings season began earlier this month, Wall Street forecasts predicted more than a 5 percent drop in earnings for the U.S. companies across the S&P 500 Index. But after Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon.com reported progress in core areas of their businesses, helping drive tech sector shares skyward Friday, the outlook for third-quarter corporate performance has improved, albeit on lower expectations. Were getting the news that the third quarter will be better than expected, said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group at U.S. Bank. We have some crucial earnings coming up with companies that have more international exposure, but the positive surprises weve seen this week will portend well for the rest of the earning season. U.S. company earnings are now estimated to have dropped in the third earnings season of the year by an average of about 3.8 percent, led by steep declines in energy and commodities, according to S&P Capital IQ. Consumer goods makers and telecommunications companies are leading gains. Overall, U.S. corporate earnings are still shrinking, but not a deeply as initially expected. Still, the numbers are showing that large U.S. companies could report their first declines in both profit and revenue since the Great Recession.

Meanwhile a strong U.S. dollar  up 15 percent against the worlds other major currencies compared to this time last year  has driven down the value of international sales for U.S. multinationals. And the energy sector is still struggling with a global supply glut. While third quarter earnings season is turning out to be not as bad as initially expected, the most crucial trend so far is that companies are lower their earnings expectations for both the fourth quarter and the year, said Northey.
