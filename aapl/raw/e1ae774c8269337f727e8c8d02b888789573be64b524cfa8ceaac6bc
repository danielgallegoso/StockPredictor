2015-11-10 SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Gemini, a waterdrop-shaped, two-wheel, self-balancing robot with two distinct personalities, will accommodate consumers' leisure needs more than ever before. The Gemini Kickstarter campaign launches on November 10th, 2015.  After the wild success of Makeblock, an educational robot kit series targeting makers and educators, the Shenzhen-based hardware startup Shenzhen Maker Works Technology Co., Ltd expanded its reach and designed the user-friendly smart robot Gemini, which requires no programming knowledge or assembling efforts on users' behalf. While standing, Gemini moves like a cute puppy, spreading joy via iridescent LED lights and flashing emoticons, and dancing to music at your command. When Gemini is equipped with a turret and crouches down, however, the robot transforms into a fearless warrior who is ready to combat.  The key to Gemini's accurate signaling and angular actions lies in the self-balancing technology. With oneMPU-60503-Axis Accelerometer and Gyroworking with STM32 MCU, through real-time analysis of related state parameters, Gemini can minimize the displacement both vertically and horizontally, in a timely manner, and control the angular offset with the utmost accuracy, remaining level with ease. Additional Features Starting at USD $99.00, the team provides different bundles for buyers. "Our mission is to make an 'Apple product' for consumer robot kits," says the founder and robot hobbyist Jasen Wang.
