2015-11-03 Apple's nextTV revolution is here, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The new box has some flaws that need addressing, and until that's done it may be best to hold off on buying the device. We believe the future of TV is apps, said CEO Tim Cook at the new Apple TV's announcement in December 2014. That may be true, but without many apps on the store, it's asking customers to buy into the promise of a future rather than one that exists right now. Developers received their prerelease toolkits just under two months ago, and there aresure to be more apps on the way. When the iPhone app store launched with the release of iPhone OS 2.0, it was on a device thathad been in the public's hands for around a year. The basic methods of interaction were not new at thatpoint, and the built-in apps demonstrated what the hardware was capable of. With the Apple TV, the new glass trackpad presents a challenge to developers. What will work best with this interaction model? What is the device good for?

 This is alongside a range of flaws present in the model on store shelves. No Bluetooth keyboard support, no podcasts app and no remote app support almost make it worse than its predecessor. The bright white background could have done with an optional dark mode, and its Siri is not as smart as the iOS version. It may be a while before the kinks getironed out and the true potential of this device is made clear.
