2015-11-09 AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Digital Turbine, Inc. (Nasdaq: APPS), the Company empowering operators and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) around the globe with end-to-end mobile solutions, announced financial results for the fiscal 2016 second quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Recent Highlights: Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results As a result of the increase in the Company's Advertising business and the March 6, 2015 acquisition of Appia, Inc., management believes that sequential comparisons are better indicators of the performance of its business given substantial operational differences between the Company today and at this time last year. As such, all comparisons are made to the prior sequential quarter, unless specifically noted. Revenue for the fiscal 2016 second quarter increased 11% to $20.7 million, or $21.2 million in constant currency versus the prior quarter $AUD exchange rate, compared with $18.7 million for the fiscal 2016 first quarter. The Company reported constant dollar sequential revenue growth in all reporting segments: within Advertising, DT Media and Appia Core revenue increased 27% and 14%, respectively; within DT Marketplace, DT Content and DT Pay revenue increased 6% on a constant currency basis and was flat on an as reported basis due to the foreign exchange impact of the Australian Dollar of approximately $0.5 million.  "Our performance in the second fiscal quarter demonstrates further adoption and growth in our DT Media business despite a seasonally low quarter for advertising spend, new device sell-through and few high-profile device launches," stated Bill Stone, CEO. "Revenues for the quarter were driven by a 27% sequential increase in DT Media revenue as we increased device penetration at a major Tier 1 U.S. carrier and a 14% sequential increase in Appia Core revenue as advertisers positioned their advertising spend ahead of the holiday season." Mr. Stone continued, "The seasonally important December quarter is off to a strong start, with October revenues reaching a record high as we continue to execute on our three levers of growth: optimizing revenue per device, expanding our product distribution, and increasing our distribution footprint. The expansion of DT Ignite app slots across all U.S. carrier-partners, together with improving targeting, is already positively impacting revenue per device, which we expect to at least achieve our $2 target this year. Combined with our expectation of higher volumes of Holiday-driven device sell-through, we expect our DT Media business to continue to increase in the current quarter and have seen considerable pre-sales for inventory across our network for the period of Thanksgiving through Christmas."  Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and non-GAAP adjusted gross margin, which excludes the amortization of intangibles, were $4.6 million and 22%, respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $4.5 million and approximately 24%, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Please see Use of Non-GAAP measures at the end of this press release for the definition of Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit/margin. This sequential comparison was primarily driven by the increasing contribution from higher-margin DT Media revenue, and Appia Core revenue contribution at approximately 20% margins, offset by lower professional services revenue in the quarter, which carries higher margins. Additionally, Non-GAAP adjusted gross margin was adversely impacted by the reduction in DT EMEA Content revenues from the termination of our Cellcom agreement in June as well as the continued shift in mix to DT Pay from DT Marketplace.  GAAP gross profit was $77,000 (0.4% GAAP gross margin) for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, versus $2.3 million (12% GAAP gross margin) for the fiscal 2016 first quarter. This sequential difference was primarily due to a $2.4 million non-cash write-off of intangibles associated with amounts attributable to customer relationships from the September 2012 acquisition of Logia Mobile Ltd. Total operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased 13% to $8.2 million compared with $9.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The reduction in total operating expenses was a result of tighter costs controls across general and administrative items, specifically lower professional fees, as well as relatively flat headcount quarter over quarter. The fiscal second quarter was also positively impacted by a reversal of an accrual related to performance-based bonuses for this fiscal year of approximately $0.5 million.  Net loss from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $8.3 million, or ($0.14) per share, based on 57.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. Net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $8.1 million, or ($0.14) per share, based on 57.4 million weighted average shares outstanding.  Net loss from continuing operations, net of income taxes, excluding the one-time write-off of $2.4 million of intangibles related to the Logia acquisition, referred to as Non-GAAP EPS, was $5.9 million, or a loss of ($0.10) per share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $2.1 million, a 35% decrease from $3.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Please see Use of Non-GAAP measures at the end of this press release for the definition of adjusted EBITDA. The Company re-evaluated its definition of adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 and redefined this non-GAAP measure to exclude any bonus adjustments.  Financial Outlook Management will address its full year Fiscal 2016 outlook on today's conference call and webcast. Mr. Stone concluded, "This quarter reflects our strengthening fundamentals across our businesses. We are confident that this strength will be reflected in results of operations in the near-medium and long term. The addition of AT&T, among other recently announced partnerships, has dramatically expanded our distribution reach globally. Existing carrier-partners have acknowledged our ability to monetize the home screens of their devices and have moved to deploy DT Ignite across additional app slots even as new carrier-partners come online in subsequent quarters. Advertisers have acknowledged our access to their target customers and are increasing their spend with us. Given this continued combined validation and incremental commitment, we expect the power of our business model to grow in the coming quarters."

The conference call will discuss guidance and other material information. Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement the Company's condensed financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), Digital Turbine uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These Non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and gross margin, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, and Non-GAAP EPS. Reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables below. Non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance, prospects for the future and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these Non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain expenses and benefits that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures that exclude such items when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations enhance the comparability of results against prior periods and allow for greater transparency of financial results. The Company believes Non-GAAP measures facilitate management's internal comparison of its financial performance to that of prior periods as well as trend analysis for budgeting and planning purposes. The presentation of Non-GAAP measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and gross margin are defined as GAAP gross profit and gross margin adjusted to exclude the effect of intangible amortization expense. Readers are cautioned that Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and gross margin should not be construed as an alternative to gross margin determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of profitability or performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP.  Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is calculated as GAAP net loss excluding the following cash and non-cash expenses: interest expense, foreign transaction gains (losses), debt financing and non-cash related expenses, debt discount and non-cash debt settlement expense, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, income taxes, asset impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of derivatives, and fees and expenses related to acquisitions. Non-GAAP EPS excludes certain non-cash amortization related cost. Because adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning, it may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Readers are cautioned that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA or Non-GAAP EPS should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP.  Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and gross margin and adjusted EBITDA are used by management as internal measures of profitability and performance. They have been included because the Company believes that the measures are used by certain investors to assess the Company's financial performance before non-cash charges and certain costs that the Company does not believe are reflective of its underlying business.  Forward-Looking Statements This news release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Statements in this news release that are not statements of historical fact and that concern future results from operations, financial position, economic conditions, product releases and any other statement that may be construed as a prediction of future performance or events, including financial projections and growth in various products are forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date made and which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may, should one or more of these risks uncertainties or other factors materialize, cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
