2015-10-14 On Oct. 12, the tech world was expecting OnePlus to announce the heavily-rumored OnePlus Mini, also referred widely as the OnePlus X. However, there was no such announcement. But now, the company has officially tweeted a teaser pointing to the arrival of a new device. To top it off, Amazon India has inadvertently listed the full OnePlus Mini specifications. OnePlus new teaser shared via Twitter and Facebook says "Beauty in the making"and "#PowerfullyBeautiful."However, there is no confirmation if the Chinese tech titan is talking about the OnePlus X or the OnePlus Mini. On the other hand, the Indian wing of Amazon has unwittingly listed the OnePlus Mini specifications momentarily. An Indian tech Website called True Tech has promptly taken a screenshot of the page before Amazon could take it down. The retailer apparently listed the configuration details under the name "OnePlus Mini,"so it is safe to assume that the upcoming device is not the "OnePlus X." Going by the listing, the OnePlus Mini will reportedly feature a 5.0-inch display and 1080p screen resolution, along with Synaptics' ClearForce technology, similar to Apples 3D Force Touch mechanism that uses pressure-sensitivity. Under the hood, an octa-core (MediaTek MT6795) Helio X10 SoC, clocked at 2.2 GHz will power the device and will be backed by a modest 2 GB of RAM. On the software end, the OnePlus Mini will run Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, alongside the Oxygen OS 3.0. A 2,450 mAh battery unit will apparently help keep the lights on. Other listed OnePlus Mini features include a metal frame around the corners of the device and Side Touch functionality. But unfortunately, the "invite-only" purchase model stays intact, according toGSM Arena. The company doesnt seem to let the infamous invitation system bite the dust any sooner. Nevertheless, readers are advised to take the reported OnePlus Mini specifications with the proverbial pinch of salt as the company has not confirmed any configuration details so far. Here is the official teaser hinting the impending launch of a powerful yet beautiful device: More than meets the eye. #PowerfullyBeautiful pic.twitter.com/2aslzqJpPB 	&mdash; OnePlus (@oneplus) October 13, 2015
