I'm a black man wearing a hoodie and strapped. According to certain social movements, I shouldn't be alive right now because the police are allegedly out to kill minorities, Hildreth wrote. Maybe if you treat police officers with respect, they will do the same to you. He finished the post by using the hashtags #BlueLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter.
