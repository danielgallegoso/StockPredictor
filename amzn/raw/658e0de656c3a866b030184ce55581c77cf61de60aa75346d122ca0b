2015-10-18 When Hollywood studios reject a movie, Netflix is ready to step in to pick up the slack. According to the Wall Street Journal, thats part of the streaming services strategy to expand from original television series to feature films. The first of which includes Beastsof No Nation, which launched simultaneously on Netflix and in a few theaters in the U.S. over the weekend of Oct. 16. Netflix forked over $12 million for the film -- about double its production budget, according to Variety. While the film is available to its 69 million global subscribers, its physical-theater audience is much smaller. Thats in part because theater chains such as AMC and Regal have chosen to boycott the film because of its simultaneous debut online. But that isnt stopping Netflix from taking on additional films. After Beasts of No Nation, the streaming service is expected to distribute at least three more films, including Adam Sandlers The Ridiculous Six, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend and Pee-wees Big Holiday. Regardless of how Beastsof No Nation"performs in the few theaters its showing at, part of the reason why Netflix isscreening it in theaters may bethatfilms are required to have a seven-day run in Los Angeles to qualify for an Academy Award nomination. Amazon is reportedly taking a slightly different approach, with films that will premiere in theaters, followed by a delayed home release, according to the Washington Post. But while Netflix is hoping that original content will be its savior, Wall Street wasnt too pleased when it revealed the company'ssubscriber growth in the third quarter. According to its quarterly filings, the streaming service took on only880,000 U.S. subscribers, well below its forecast of 1.15 million. Overseas Netflix had better luck, with 2.74 million international subscribers, above the Wall Street estimateof 2.4 million.
