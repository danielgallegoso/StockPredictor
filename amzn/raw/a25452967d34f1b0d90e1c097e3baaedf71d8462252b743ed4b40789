2015-10-19 DUBLIN, Oct. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9r62mk/the_m2m_and_iot) has announced the addition of SNS Research's new report "The M2M & IoT Ecosystem: 2015 - 2030 - Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies, Industry Verticals & Forecasts" to their offering.  The report estimates that global spending on M2M and IoT technologies will reach nearly $250 Billion by 2020, driven by a host of vertical market applications including but not limited to connected car services, remote asset tracking, healthcare monitoring, smart metering, digital signage, home automation and intelligent buildings.  M2M (Machine-to-Machine) refers to the flow of data between physical objects, without the need for human interaction. M2M connectivity has opened a multi-billion dollar revenue opportunity for mobile operators, MVNOs and service aggregators, addressing the application needs of several verticals markets. By enabling network connectivity among physical objects, M2M has also initiated the IoT (Internet of Things) vision - a global network of sensors, equipment, appliances, smart devices and applications that can communicate in real time.  The M2M & IoT Ecosystem: 2015 - 2030 - Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies, Industry Verticals & Forecasts report presents an in-depth assessment of the M2M and IoT ecosystem including enabling technologies, key trends, market drivers, challenges, vertical market applications, deployment case studies, collaborative initiatives, regulatory landscape, standardization, opportunities, future roadmap, value chain, ecosystem player profiles and strategies. The report also presents market size forecasts from 2015 till 2030. The forecasts are segmented for 8 vertical markets, 7 access networking technologies, 6 regions and over 70 leading countries.  The report has the following key findings:  - The report estimates that global spending on M2M and IoT technologies will reach nearly $250 Billion by 2020, driven by a host of vertical market applications including but not limited to connected car services, remote asset tracking, healthcare monitoring, smart metering, digital signage, home automation and intelligent buildings - The installed base of M2M connections will grow at a CAGR of nearly 30% between 2015 and 2020, eventually accounting for over 10 Billion connections worldwide - The report estimates that multimedia and video applications will account for more than 20% of the revenue generated by M2M and IoT services by 2020, amid growing incorporation of LTE in M2M modules and gateways - Besides optimizing their cellular networks for M2M services, mobile operators are increasingly investing in LPWA networks for low power, low bandwidth IoT applications  Key Topics Covered:  1: Introduction  2: An Overview of M2M & IoT  3: Key Enabling Technologies  4: Collaboration, Standardization & Regulatory Landscape  5: Vertical Market Applications, Opportunities and Case Studies  6: Industry Roadmap & Value Chain  7: Key Ecosystem Players  8: Market Analysis and Forecasts  9: Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations  Companies Mentioned - Partial List of the 248 Companies Featured - 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) - ABB Group - Accenture - Aclara Technologies - Actility - ADT Corporation - Aeris Communications - AIOTI (Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation) - Airbiquity - Airbus Group - Alcatel-Lucent - Allegion - AllSeen Alliance - Altair Semiconductor - Amazon.com - AMCi Wireless - Amrica Mvil - Ansaldo STS - Apple - Arduino - ARIB (Association of Radio Industries and Business, Japan) - Arkessa - ARM Holdings - Arqiva - Arrayent - Arynga - AT&T - AT&T Mobility  For more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9r62mk/the_m2m_and_iot  Source: SNS Research Media Contact:  Laura Wood, +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net  To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-m2m--iot-ecosystem-2015-2030-report---spending-on-m2m-and-iot-technologies-is-expected-to-account-for-nearly-250-billion-by-2020-300161753.html SOURCE  Research and Markets
