2015-11-12 Teen Mom 2 stars Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin have had their share of ups and downs as a newlywed couple, but during a recent interview with Radar Online, the MTV reality star said things are getting better. She and her husband are communicating more. I think we kind of understand each other a lot better right now, she saidin an exclusive interview Thursday. We dont have a whole lot of drama right now and we are just trying to make things work and figure things out. Its a big improvement for the young couple, especially since they toyed withthe idea of divorce during Season 6 of TM2. Part of the problem in their relationship was that Lowry struggled with being a mother, wife, student and friend. Its like this weird dynamic and I think just finding a balance where I can have my family and my social life --thats where we have to figure it out,she told Radar Online Thursday.

 Its also hard for her to connect with her peers. Its hard for me to balance a family life and a social life knowing that I cant relate to a lot of the kids that I go to school with, Lowry, 23, added. If Lowry didnt have enough on her plate, she also wrote a new book, Love Is Bubblegum. She was inspired to write the childs book after her oldest son, Isaac, asked her what love was. She promoted Love is Bubblegum on her official Instagram page Wednesday. If people preorder the $10 book on Amazon or Barnes and Noble, they will receive $25 in shopping credits. We hope you will enjoy this book and discover some shop favorites as well! she said. Lowry confirmed that she will appear in Season 7 of Teen Mom 2. The MTV cameras will film a book party, she told Wet Paint last month. An air date for the new season has not been set. Follow me on Twitter  @mariamzzarella
