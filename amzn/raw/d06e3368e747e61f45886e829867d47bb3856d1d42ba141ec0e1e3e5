2015-10-26 LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --AEE Technology Inc., a global leader in the action camera and drone industry, today announced the launch of their newest action camera: the S40 Pro. Featuring a fun, bright red casing, the action camera carries a price tag any enthusiast or novice will enjoy at an amazing $150. The S40 Pro compares favorably to other action cameras on the market such as the GoPro HERO4 Session, with an eye-popping price that's more than half off the Session. The camera is one of the lightest on the market, weighing in at a diminutive 2.5 ounces, which makes it a must-have for any gift list. Perfect for the upcoming holiday season, the S40 Pro is the latest entry in the AEE action camera collection and is compatible with over 40 available accessories, including a 40m waterproof housing. Features include: The S40 Pro allows for time lapsed videos and images, shooting at 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 second intervals and burst shooting at 8 frames per second. The camera also uses a microSD 64GB card and is Windows XP SP2/Vista/Win 7 or above and Mac OS compatible. The demand for action cameras is at an all-time high, with 5.5 million units being shipped worldwide in 2014, up from 3.3 million in 2013. Technology forecasters are expecting this demand to rise to 9 million units by 2018. GoPro's recent IPO has further brought attention to the surging category. AEE is a major player in the already booming Asian and European markets, with revenues topping $55 million in 2014. Now, AEE hopes to conquer the North American markets and win a place in the backpacks of adventurers and casual users alike.
