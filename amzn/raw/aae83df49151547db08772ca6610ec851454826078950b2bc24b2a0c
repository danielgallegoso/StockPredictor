2015-10-16 NEW YORK, Oct. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Imagine the world was once not just peaceful, but filled only with harmony and serenity and all the animals got along just fine. Paradise. A time before the existence of humans. And one day, one single tiny little bee, a curious and mischievous one, was getting bored of living the eternal life of a mother bee and wanted to try out her stinger, to see what happens. The Princess kissed a frog, poetically speaking, though in reality it was a mother bee, (queen bee) who stung the frog. The Bee's DNA slips into the frog, its eggs mutate, the offspring grows fluff on its skin, which happens to be of the exact structure as bee fur, a new hybrid comes about  out of which a species evolves which will be the only mammal with slit pupils like reptiles and amphibians, the cat.

The first question asked is why all this happened? Because one single mother bee was so nosy, stung a frog, etc. and involuntarily started the entire evolution process leading to the creation of mankind. This bee's life is the focus of new history thriller The Tall Tale, by award winning author LeaganE. Kasper,written from the point of view of a bee, remembering how it all began and how she stood eye witness to the consequences of having stung a frog, eventually completing the evolutionary cycle by evolving into a human being.The Tall Tale is revolutionary. What if a single bee was responsible for the human evolution?Would the bees be upset with her, now having to work for man? The TallTale was released in English and in German, as paperback, the German Title is" Die RiesenFabel", available at book sellers worldwide andonline.
