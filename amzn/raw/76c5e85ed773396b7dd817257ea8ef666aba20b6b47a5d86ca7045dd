2015-11-02 Amazon plansto implement a progressive parental leave policy, beginning Jan. 1, the Seattle Times reported Monday. Under the new policy, some birth mothers will be able to take up to 20 weeks of maternity leave, and all new parents, regardless of gender, will be offered six weeks of parental leave. The new policy marks the first time that Amazon has offered paid paternity leave, which has been a growing trend among tech companies in recent years. Earlier this year, Netflix announced an "unlimited leave" for new moms and dads, allowing them to take off as much time as they would like within the first year of giving birth or adopting. The following day, Microsoft announced it will be boosting paid leave for new parents as well. Under its previous policy, Amazon had offered birth mothers up to four weeks of paid maternity leave before giving birth if a doctor found it to be medically necessary. The company also offered birth mothers 10 weeks of paid maternity leave after giving birth. With the additional six weeks offered to all new parents under the new policy, some birth mothers will be eligible for 20 weeks of paid maternity leave. Amazon also announced a new leave share program, which allows employees to gift all or part of the six-week leave they are offered to their spouse or partner who might not have paid paternal leave. So, an Amazon employee can go back to work, while his or her partner gets paid by Amazon to stay at home with their new child.   .@Amazon offers new perk for new parents: more paid leave: https://t.co/v7K3jcfLEg pic.twitter.com/NcxZ2z7Z8D 	&mdash; The Seattle Times (@seattletimes) November 2, 2015
