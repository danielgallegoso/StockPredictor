In conjunction with this launch, the company has been named a CES 2016 Innovation Awards Honoree in the tablets, e-readers and mobile computing product category for the BrydgeMini. Products entered in this prestigious program are judged by a preeminent panel of independent industrial designers, independent engineers and members of the trade media to honor outstanding design and engineering in cutting edge consumer electronics products across 27 product categories.

The sophisticated yet minimalistic design consists of clean lines and angles that perfectly complement the sleek aesthetic of the iPad mini and gives users a unified experience when moving between the BrydgeMini and tablet. With adjustable brightness backlit keys strategically placed to correspond with the location of core functions of the iPad mini, the BrydgeMini is the ideal counterpart to create a holistic laptop experience.  "When creating the BrydgeMini, our primary focus was designing a keyboard that not only performed perfectly alongside the iPad mini, but also complemented it on both a functional and visual level," said Nicholas Smith, CEO of Brydge. "The iPad mini is an amazing device that has truly redefined how we work, learn and play at school, the office and at home. With the launch of the BrydgeAir, we made the iPad Air experience even better; by introducing the BrydgeMini, we have extended that experience to iPad mini users."

This patented apparatus allows users to maneuver viewing angles across a 180-degree spectrum, ideal for use in both cramped areassuch as airline seatsand spacious settings like living rooms and offices.
