2015-10-28 Four drivers for Prime Now, Amazon's one and two-hour delivery service, filed a lawsuit in California Tuesday alleging that Amazon wrongly classified them as independent contractorswhen they were effectively employees. Their case adds to a slew of recent similar lawsuits filed by drivers at ride-hailing or on-demand delivery services includingUber, FedExand Postmates. These are human beings. They are not drones, Beth Ross, anattorney who is representing the four drivers in the case,Taree Truong et al. vs. Amazon.com Inc et al., told SFGate.Ross represented FedEx Ground drivers in California in a lawsuit alleging that FedEx had wrongly classified more than 2,000 FedEx drivers as independent contractors instead of employees. FedEx ultimately agreed in 2014 to a $228 million settlement. The Amazon Prime Now drivers were hired by Scoobeez, a contractor that hires hundreds of drivers for the on-demand delivery service, but they work exclusively for Amazon, donning Amazon Prime Now uniforms and taking regular shifts and assignments from the company -- signs that they are being treated as employees, according to the lawsuit. Yet by being classified as contractors, workers had been deprivedof overtime pay, breaksfor meals and other rights given to full-time employees. Employers are required by law to withhold income taxes for their employees and pay a portion of their taxes for Social Security and Medicare, for instance.
