2015-10-27 HONG KONG, Oct. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Global Sources (NASDAQ: GSOL) opens its fashion sourcing show today at AsiaWorld-Expo with the widest selection of fashion items in Asia, including apparel, accessories, footwear and fabrics. Running through Oct. 30, there are three co-located shows under one roof: With more than 1,300 booths, the shows bring together top suppliers from mainland China, India, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam and other Asian territories. Buyers will find a wide range of products including casual and fashion bags, shoes and hosiery, hair accessories, fashion jewelry, scarves and shawls, ready-to-wear garments, functional fabrics, sports and casual wear, sweaters and knitwear, underwear, and swimwear.  President of Global Sources Fashion Group, Livia Yip, said: "In addition to showcasing a range of products and suppliers from across Asia, we continue to see growing participation from branded companies. The event is quickly evolving from a substantially original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sourcing show to an event where 30 to 40 percent of exhibitors are marketing their own designs and brands. As a result, we not only provide a sourcing platform for volume buyers and retailers like Zara, H&M, Macy's, Victoria's Secret and Marks & Spencer, but also can help entrepreneurial buyers from Amazon, eBay, and even the boutique shops across Asia to find suppliers best suited to their needs. "We are forging ahead in efforts to build an ecosystem with content from traditional and new manufacturing regions in Asia. We aim to help manufacturers move up the value chain by connecting them with young designers and new technologies applicable to fashion," added Yip.  Key highlights for the show are:  Among the thousands of buyers pre-registered to attend the shows are Anteprima, Burberry, Carrefour, Cortefiel, El Corte Ingles, FILA, Fossil, Intersport, Laura Ashley, Li & Fung, Marks & Spencer, Sears, Tchibo, Triumph, Woolworths and Zalora.
