2015-11-13 Huluis talks to sell a stake to Time Warner Inc. in a deal that would value the video-streaming company at $5 billion and help itcompetewith Netflix and Amazon.com. The proposal is for Time Warner to become an equal partner withHulu's current owners, The Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox and Comcast, who now each own a third, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the talks. Aside from cash, Time Warner would agree to license more content to Hulu than it already has, according to the Journal. Time Warner owns Warner Bros., which produces for all major broadcast and cable networks; Turner Broadcasting,which owns TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network and TruTV;and HBO, the newspaper pointed out. According to Walt Disney'sChief Operating Officer Thomas Staggs, Hulu will boost spending tobuycontent or produceits own, the Journalreported. It's already bought content and producedoriginal programming worth $1.5 billion this year, the Journal said, citing Nomura Securities. That figure is up from $600 million in 2014.Recent deals include rights to Seinfeld, South Park and Empire, Bloomberg Newsreported. According to the Journal,Hulu has gotten deals in part by positioningitself as friendly to the televisionindustry, which is worried about so-called cord-cutting as customers shift to Netflix and other Internet options. With Time Warner in the mix, it is hard to see a scenario where Hulu doesnt become a more meaningful competitor to Netflix, Bloomberg reported Paul Sweeney, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, as saying.
