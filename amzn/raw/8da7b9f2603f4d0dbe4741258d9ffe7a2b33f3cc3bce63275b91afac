2015-11-05 NEW YORK, Nov. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --A heart-warming world of Christmas magic comes alive on Placido Domingo's new holiday album, My Christmas (Sony Classical). Available now, the album is filled with seasonal favorites, plus duets with a variety of special guests including Idina Menzel, Jackie Evancho, Placido Domingo Jr., The Piano Guys and others. My Christmas features Domingo performing his favorites numbers like "Guardian Angels,"the haunting songcomposed by Harpo Marx and made famous by Mario Lanza with Idina Menzel, fresh from her triumph as the voice of Queen Elsa in Disney's Frozen; "Pie Jesu" the pure, ethereal melody from Andrew Lloyd Webber with Jackie Evancho, the 15 year-old American singing phenomenon, who is also the youngest top-10 debut artist in U.S. history; "White Christmas," the evergreen Irving Berlin classic with his son Placido Domingo Jr.; and "Silent Night"with The Piano Guys, whose witty mash-ups of classical favorites and pop standards have been seen over half a billion times on YouTube. Other artists featured on My Christmas singing holiday classics with Domingo include the German superstar Helene Fischer ("What Child Is This"), whose albums have sold more than 9 million copies to date; the French heart-throb tenor Vincent Niclo ("Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"); and the New Zealand singer Hayley Westenra performing "Loving Christmas,"a new song writtenby Placido Domingo Jr. The must-hear seasonal favorites continue with Domingo and Banda el Recodo joining together for the Spanish-language standard "Feliz Navidad"as well as the Voices of Los Angeles Opera's Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artist Program for "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen."  In addition to such well-loved songs, carols and anthems, there is Mendelssohn's rousing "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing";and an arrangement of Mozart's sublime "Ave verum corpus," composed shortly before his death. A festive symphonic accompaniment is provided by Czech National Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Eugene Kohn.
