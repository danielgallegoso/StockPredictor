2015-11-03 NEW YORK, Nov. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- A parent after years of struggling to improve her child's grades and standardized test scores discovers how to improve her child's grades in 30 days using a revolutionary method. The book is called Vocabulary to Teach Kids: 30 days to improved vocabulary and increased reading comprehension by Julie Jones. In the book, she explains her easy step-by-step method so that parents can get the same results. Julie Jones, a parent,struggled for years with being told that her child can't learn. All parents want to provide the best education that they can for their child. She bought workbooks,paid for tutoring services. Nothing worked, she only saw minimal improvement, at best. Education hasn't changed in the past 100 years Education in public schools hasn't changed in the past 100 years. Teachers are taught to lecture and students are taught to stare straight forward to pay attention during the lecture with very little interaction. Even assignments are distributed and students are given little to no instructions. Standardized Testing is Important Grades aren't the only thing that is important to a child's academic career. Students must also pass standardized tests such as the NJ Ask in New Jersey and the common core which was developed by the Gates Foundation. According to the Orlando Sentinel, Rich Roach, a long-standing school board member in Florida, took the FCAT, which is Florida's statewide assessment test and failed. It proves the point that parents, teachers and school administration must understand the standardized tests, in general, the school curriculum to prepare students for the real world. "I believe testing is important because jobs are based on performance evaluations which is similar to standardized tests so it is important that kids have this type of mentality whether in school or on a job even if they are a cashier," says Julie Jones. Reading Comprehension is Tough to Teach The book teaches them the prefixes they need to know to understand the most common words used in children's textbooks and school work. By knowing these prefixes, your child will have an improved vocabulary and increased reading comprehension. The book is available on Amazon.com for $29.99.
