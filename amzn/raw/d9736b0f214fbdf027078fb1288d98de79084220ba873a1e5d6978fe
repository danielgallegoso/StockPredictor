2015-11-11 The high demand for the BlackBerry Priv has apparently made the Canadian tech giant to postpone the shipping dates of new orders. BlackBerry Priv, the retro slider phone powered by Android, is reportedly doing very well. The company started shipping the flagship handset from Nov. 6 for those preordered from the official store. AT&T, on the other hand, started selling the smartphone from its stores on the same day. The latest news is thatinterested buyers planning to purchase the Priv from BlackBerry's online store will see the device reach their door steps only in the week of Nov. 23. When Mobile Syrup requested the company for a comment, a BlackBerry spokesperson reportedly said, "Weve begun fulfilling shipments as of Nov. 6, but due to demand weve phased shipments and this is for next wave." Apart from BlackBerrys own store and AT&T, e-retailer Amazon started offering the Priv via its Website. As it turns out, this handset sold out within hours in Amazon. Verizon, on the other hand, will reportedly be selling the BlackBerry flagship shortly. Eventually, New York City's B&H Photo will also be offering the Priv. Speaking of price, the BlackBerry Priv will set the buyers back $699. In case, the Priv manages to surpass the expectations, BlackBerry might build a new variant of Passport powered by Android OS, Phone Arena reported.
