financi loss base on the same model theyv use for generat to forecast the damag from natur disast air worldwid is a risk model firm that work on behalf of more than 400 insur and reinsur compani to guess how much their client will lose annual base on the probabl of a major data breach just like they can reason estim the damag from a hurrican slam into the jersey shore they can brace for a cyberattack that crippl a municip electr grid for the properti side wed look at if you have hail resist roof mean less damag said scott stranski princip scientist at air worldwid for the cyber side mayb your stolen record are encrypt and now they dont realli have valu to hacker on the other side mayb you have a lot of employe who tend to go on social media a lot more than employe in similar companiesyour go to open up more social media attack one possibl scenario air stranski compar to the cyberequival of hurrican andrew which kill 65 peopl and result in 26 billion in damag 1992 dollar would be a monthlong attack on the amazon cloud if it were to be taken down and it is a trophi target for hacker you can imagin ten of thousand of compani have downtim all at onc he said hurrican andrew was a power hurrican that destroy hous all along a small locat it a huge aggreg risk small bank to larg retail from the us and germani and china and from all over the place would all suffer busi interrupt most cyberinsur polici cover busi interrupt reduc breach fallout cyberinsur polici have grown by 30 percent each year sinc 2013 at beazley an intern insur accord to uk focus group leader and underwrit paul bantick if your a larg compani in the us youv either bought an insur polici or youv look at one he said and now middl market and smaller organ are realiz they have exposur polici can cover an array of busi cost from regular secur updat to notifi affect custom and clean up or at least mitig the inevit public relat disast but mani plan also cover cyberextort when busi have no choic but to pay a ransom in the thousand of dollar to regain access to their data and new strain of malwar that are now more preval than ever five year ago we were talk about lost laptop lost backup and rogu employe said bantick ad that now cyberextort is fair common soni pictur had a 60 million cyberinsur polici with marsh insur befor the compani was shred by the hack that was later blame on north korea leak document show the data breach fell well within the bound of insur and the cost shouldnt be anyth disrupt to our budget ceo michael lynton told reuter in januari various expert have peg the loss at 100 million and soni said in march it would need to pay 35 million out of pocket to restor it financi and it system your insur compani is hire hacker almost carrier arent wait to get behind a compani firewal befor decid to offer insur instead theyr contract compani that can examin how long a malwar strain or distribut denial of servic attack torment an applic watch the compani reaction help the would be insur assess the applic cybersecur and thus the financi risk of enrol that compani if you see a particular botnet on a network on one day and then it gone the next day that mean the compani was infect but they dealt with it effect said ira scharf general manag for worldwid insur at bitsight technolog which work with aig ace onebeacon and a rang of other  other time we see on a network a particular virus and it there one day and it persist for 50 or 60 day and then you know the compani doesnt have the sophist procedur in place to detect or mitig the problem bitsight has a databas of at least 33000 companiesand test for thing like ssl certif spam activ anti phish measuresand thousand of other factor the compani say it doe not perform penetr test or intrus softwar measur popular among hacker and intellig agenc if you know about it you better fix it target 2013 data breach cost the compani 248 million onli 90 million of which was offset by an insur polici that could be becaus the malici softwar lurk on point of sale regist at everi locat in the us was a known threat month befor the breach was discov then home depot report 43 million in expens when it was
