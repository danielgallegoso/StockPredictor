2015-11-07  11 07 imag by geralt via pixabay when evalu stock there are liter hundr of differ metric you can use to judg the financi chop of an individu companyw fool certain do not believ that you need to have them all master befor you can begin invest but we do feel that there are a hand that matter a great deal we ask our team of motley fool contributor to explain an invest metric that they believ both new and season investor should fulli understand befor they commit ani capit to the market read below to see what they had to say matt frankelon metric i alway look at when make an invest is theinterest coverag ratio which is also refer to as time interest earn the interest coverag ratio is calcul by divid a compani earn befor interest and tax ebit by it interest expens on it outstand debt this let us know how mani time over a compani could pay it interest oblig base on it current earn for exampl a compani with ebit of 4 million and interest expens of 1 million would have interest coverag of 4 time this is an import aspect of a compani financi condit becaus it reveal the compani margin of safeti to absorb advers condit and not have to dip into it reserv or borrow even more to cover interest payment in general i look for compani with a minimum interest coverag of 25 time but higher than this is prefer for exampl one of my portfolio core holdingsrealti incomenyseo has interest coverag of 42 time what this impli is that even if an econom catastroph wipe out 76 of realti incom ebit the compani could still afford to pay it creditor anoth metric worth know is fix charg coverag which is similar to interest coverag but includ all of a compani fix expens such as prefer stock dividend agre upon debt princip payment and leas expens know a compani interest and fix charg coverag can give you a good idea of how financi solid a compani is as well as it abil to make it through the tough time brian feroldiwhil there are plenti of metric that can be use to measur the valueof a compani that matur and profit it harder to measur the worth of a compani that hasnt begun to earn a profit for these compani it can be use to look at the price to sale ratio which is calcul by divid a compani market capit by it combin revenu from the last four quarter the price to sale ratio show how much investor are pay for 1 dollar in sale for a compani and while this number vari depend of the compani sector it nevertheless a good measur of valu takeamazon nasdaqamzna an exampl sinc the compani is constant plow it profit back into the busi to drive growth it pe ratio is next to useless in determin valu howev if you look at the price to sale ratio foramazon you get a better idea of it valuat here amazon price to sale ratio over the last five year this metric was near a five year low at the begin of the year impli it share were a good valu at the time the market seem to have agre with that assess as amazon share proceed to climb by 111 year to date current amazon stock is trade at a five year high when look at this metric which could indic that share are expens at the moment no singl metric is enough to determin the valu of a busi but i think the price to sale ratio is one all investor should know adam galasinvestor often focus on the earn payout ratio to determin if a specif compani dividend or buyback program is sustain but the free cash flow payout ratio is a better metric to use this is becaus earn typic includ numer noncash charg such as depreci amort and one time event like write off or profit asset sale these charg can caus earn to swing wild and make determin the long term viabil of a capit return program unreli convers free cash flow repres how much actual money a compani has left over after pay expens and invest to grow sale thus while earn is a way of keep score free cash flow is what actual run a busi and fund it buyback and dividend applenasdaqaaplprovid a good exampl over the past year it earn were 534billion while it paid out 116 billion in dividend and bought back 353 billion instock use the earn payout ratio it look like appl is return 88 of profit to sharehold that a high level becaus it mean that should sale and profit dip it might make the capit return program unsustain howev appl free cash flow over the last 12 month was actual 698billion that mean it free cash flow payout ratio is onli 67 thus we can see that appl sharehold cash return bonanza is actual veri sustain even if sale were to stop grow or declin substanti selena maranjian one invest metric that worth understand is the gross margin there are actual three key profit margin that you can determin from a compani incom statement gross margin oper margin and net margin start at the top with total revenu and then subtract the cost of good sold cog which repres the direct cost of produc the compani product andor servic your left with the gross profit divid that by total revenu and youll get the gross profit margin differ industri and busi tend to have differ rang of gross margin compar the gross margin of peer and you can see how well a compani is compet against it closest rival for examplechipotl mexican grill nysecmg gross margin was recent near 28 while that ofmcdonaldsnysemcd was 38 show that it cost more for chipotl to produc it offer which is not surpris given that it differenti itself as offer higher qualiti ingredi you can move further down the incom statement to learn more from the gross profit oper cost such as support staff salari util bill and advertis expens are subtract leav the oper profit divid that by total revenu and youll get the oper margin which reflect anoth level of effici final to reach the bottom line net profit margin we subtract expens such as tax and interest payment from oper profit to arriv at net incom or a net loss divid that by total revenu to get the net margin that reflect how much of everi dollar of sale a compani get to keep as profit in our quick serv exampl mcdonald has the higher net margin low margin arent deal breaker though if theyr coupl with high volum you can learn a lot in the margin sean william there perhap no more wide follow fundament metric than the price to earn or pe ratio when discuss valu it the tool that most investor will pull out of their pocket but pe ratio have one fundament flaw theyr backward look which doe us no good in a market that alway look to price stock base on their long term outlook that whi we have what i believ to be one of the most import metric at our dispos the priceearn to growth ratio or peg ratio peg ratio take into account a compani current valuat it pe ratio and most import it expect futur growth rate this allow investor to determin not onli whether a compani is valu attract base on it previous report earn result but if it trade at a possibl discount to futur growth as an exampl a stock with a pe of 15 and a five year growth rate of 10 would have a peg ratio of 15 divid by 10 or 15 what an attract peg ratio you ask it all depend on the industri but the unwritten rule is that anyth with a peg ratio below two could be consid attract in the right light while anyth abov two might be fair valu or overpr person i like look for compani with a peg ratio around one if im realli seek out a valu stock id suggest run a stock screen of your favorit sector or industri and use peg ratio as the filter to begin your research the next billion dollar isecret the world biggest tech compani forgot to show you someth at it recent event but a few wall street analyst and the fool didnt miss a beat there a small compani that power their brand new gadget and the come revolut in technolog and we think it stock price has near unlimit room to run for earli in the know investor to be one of them just click here
