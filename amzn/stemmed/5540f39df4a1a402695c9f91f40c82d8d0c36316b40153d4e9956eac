2015-11-02  11 02 what if the alli had lostworld war ii that is a big what if but that is exact the question new amazon seri the man in the high castl aim to answer base on the 1962 novel by sci fi writer phillip k dick the show imagin a world where the nazi not the us led alli power wonth war lead to an invas of americawher nazigermani claimedth east coast andjapan took the west coast in this world hitler is aliv and in charg but his health is fade spark tension in the us where a resist inspir by mysteri newsreel footag depict an altern univers alli victori is grow and relat with japan are

time to preview the seri which begin stream all 10 season 1 episodeson amazon prime onnov 20 the first two episod are current avail to all amazon usersread the full interview below intern busi time how did you get involv in the project carsten norgaard i had heard about the project for a while i guess it had been circl for year i think execut produc ridley scott had tri to make it as a featur film at one time when the opportun present itself i had alway been a fan of phillip k dick who wrote minor report total recal the adjust team hes a veri prolif and incred product writer then the prospect of be in the ultim what if what if the alli forc had not won the second world war the imagin can run rampant with that ibtim you said you were a fan of the book are you a histori buff too were you passion about the project in that sens norgaard i think that come from denmark we were occupi by nazi germani so we kind of grew up out of this histori plus as far as i recal this is one of the first time the unit state has ever been occupi andsplit in two i cant recal anoth stori about that ibtim this is an american show that will probabl be seen by a most american audienc and it focus is definit the hypotheticalus nazi german relationship but doe come from denmark give you a differ perspect at all norgaard i think the what if in this specif scenario has intrigu in lot of place europ asia it was so close for sometim a few differ move if hitler had not gone into russia for exampl and we could have been look at someth like this so i think it has a veri broad appeal i would be surpris if it was not equal watch in denmark ibtim tell us about your charact what are your motiv for deal with the japanesebehind the back of the nazi norgaard i play a doubl agent a swedish businessman victor bayn who is realli nazi colonel rudolph wegen he is worri that a power vacuum could occur if hitler die it might lead to anoth war with the japanes so in secret he is tri to make an agreement with his japanes counterpart to avoid anoth war i think deep insideh is a good guy we are all product of our environ hes a complex charact hesdon terribl thing and that guilt weigh veri heavili on him and has mess up his famili life so you could say he is haunt by the atroc he has commit on behalf of the nazi empir his effort to avert war between the japanes and the nazi empir areaton or redempt so to speak ibtim in your scene withcari hiroyuki tagawa you guy both speak veri cryptic about fate and destini how is that a theme for the show overal norgaard i think it isan under theme it is interest work with cari he and i develop a great synergi for each other and each other cultur so it kind of marri with the storylin i think we manag to bring that to the screen i hope carsten norgaard pictur star in the man in the high castl which premier all 10 season 1 episod on amazon prime on nov 20 bettina niedermann ibtimesmost of the seri revolv around the us resist to the nazi but your storylin with cari is about the nazi germani japanes power struggl it interest how a differ outcom in the war has still led to what is essenti anoth cold war norgaard histori repeat itself right ibtimesexact how is this conflict differ from the cold war we know from histori class how is it the same norgaard well a lot of thing come down to trust do you trust the other side what is the other side do we see it today with russia again where we are not sure what the other side is do and they are not quit sure what we are do ibtimeswhat was the experi like work with amazon norgaard we had a lot of pride on set not just becaus of the great phillip k dick materi and frank spotnitz interpret but also becaus of the great review we had out of the gate with this whole bing watch scenario which im start to love you dont have to wait you get it right away bing watch is like read a modern book you read it as fast or as slow as you want at your own discret i think the byproduct is fan have a real chanc to get hook on the materi and like the stori ibtimesit sound like it was definit a posit experi norgaard i think there was a level of freedom that was given to the project everybodi listen to what everybodi had to say there were daili exchang about charact wardrob i think for myself it was impress it was just collabor at it purest hope that make for great view ibtimeswhat lesson doe the show have to teach about polit or the state of the world today norgaard look at all the stuff that happen with isi and the middl east and then the second world war it the same atroc and i think mistrust is evid on all of the level of how everyth work today all you need to do is listen to the polit debat ibtimesi the show a bit cynic about histori it seem like there is an argument in the seri that it may be naiv to think you can chang the word norgaard i think the show highlight what can be chang hope peopl can see thing on the show and then take them to the world today i dont think there is ani utopia but we are all in charg of our own destini and we can choos to live in a place where most of your view and thing that make you tick are cover ibtimesw can at least do better than nazi right norgaard i think so the first two episod of the man in the high castl are stream now on amazon prime all 10 episod of season 1 will be avail on nov 20 watch the trailer for the man in the high castl below
