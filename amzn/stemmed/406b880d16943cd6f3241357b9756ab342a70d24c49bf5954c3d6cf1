presidenti campaign there been a lot of advocaci group and industri group spend time in dc so there obvious interest there to me that would repres a huge opportun for a candid rubio still has a way to go befor secur silicon valley full support but some say the candid has a strong shot at do so thank to his pro busi view and his stanc on h1b visa that would allow the tech industri to bring in more immigr worker addit rubio youth energi and optim could prove attract to the tech industri as was the case for presid barack obama in the last two elect rubio doe appeal to that generat sens of optim

yet to challeng other republicancandidatesfor the tech industri support she trail rubio bush and new jersey gov chris christi in silicon valley donat but the candid is show there a chanc she could ralli an industri she onc play a key role in in silicon valley the support for car will fall larg around ideolog line with the libertarian lean folk be veri support said john mracek ceo of netseer base in mountain view an onlin media and audienc target compani fiorina has been clear about her support for small govern and light regul view that have the potenti to resound with some of the tech industri libertarian big name ventur capitalist like marc andreessen and peter thiel mracek said in august ventur capitalist tom perkin one of the hp board member who led fiorina 2005 ouster from the
