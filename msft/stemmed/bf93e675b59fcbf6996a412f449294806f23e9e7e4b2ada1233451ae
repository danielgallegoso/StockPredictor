said last week that it tell us technolog firm about the most serious flaw it find more than 90 percent of the time the re assur may be mislead becaus the nsa often use the vulner to make it own cyber attack first accord to current and former us govern offici onli then doe nsa disclos them to technolog vendor so that they can fix the problem and ship updat program to custom the offici said at issu is the us polici on so call zero day the serious softwar flaw that are of great valu to both hacker and spi becaus no one know about them the term zero day come from the amount of warn user get to patch their machin protect a two day flaw is less danger becaus it emerg two day after a patch is avail the best known use of zero day was in stuxnet the attack virus develop by the nsa and it isra counterpart to infiltr the iranian nuclear program and sabotag centrifug that were enrich uranium befor it discoveri in 2010 stuxnet took advantag of previous unknown flaw in softwar from microsoft corp and siemen ag to penetr the facil without trigger secur program a shadowi but robust market has develop for the buy and sell of zero day and as reuter report in may 2013 the nsa is the world top buyer of the flawsth nsa also discov flaw through it own cyber program use some to break into comput and telecommun system oversea as part of it primari spi mission some zero day are worth more than other depend on such factor as the difficulti in find them and how widespread the target softwar is while some can be bought for as littl as 50000 a promin zero day broker said this week that he had agre to pay 1 million to a team that devis a way to break into a fulli updat appl iphon chaouki bekrar of the firm zerodium told reuter the iphon techniqu would like be sold to us custom onli includ govern agenc and veri big corpor govern offici say there is a natur tension as to whether zero day should be use for offens oper or disclos to tech compani and their custom for defens purpos in the wake of revel by former nsa contractor edward snowden and a reuter report that detail how the govern paid secur firm rsa to includ nsa taint encrypt in it softwarea white hous review panel recommend tilt govern polici more toward defens presid barack obama cybersecur coordin michael daniel then said he had reinvigor the review process that decid what to do about each flaw that come to govern attent the detail of that process remain classifi but interview show that the chang sharpli elev the role of the depart of homeland secur which is respons for defens and had not previous been at the center of inter government debat on the issu after daniel describ the revamp process broad the activist electron frontier foundat su for document about it under the freedom of inform act the most signific releas in that case came in septemb with an undat and part redact 13 page memo outlin how agenc should handl knowledg about softwar vulner the memo state that the nsas defens arm the inform assur director serv as the execut secretariat for the process homeland secur a redact portion of the memo list the agenc that particip in the process as a matter of cours an unredact part refer to other agenc that can ask to particip on a case by case basi and the depart of homeland secur appear in that section along with the depart of state justic treasuri and commerc two former white hous offici said that the memo refer to the old system befor daniel reorgan it about a year and a half ago in an interview daniel told reuter that dhs was a key part of the new system which is run by the white hous nation secur council dhs is at the tabl in the process im run daniel said an nsa spokeswoman refer question about it polici to the nsc where a spokesman refer reuter back to the nsa the nsa say on it websit that it understand the need to use most flaw for defens in the vast major of case respons disclos a newli discov vulner is clear in the nation interest accord to the websit but there are legitim pros and con to the decis to disclos vulner and the trade off between prompt disclosur and withhold knowledg of some vulner for a limit time can have signific consequ disclos a vulner can mean that we forgo an opportun to collect crucial foreign intellig that could thwart a terrorist attack stop the theft of our nation intellectu properti or discov even more danger vulner that are be use to exploit our network the agenc said histor nsa has releas more than 91 percent of vulner discov in product that have gone through our intern review process and that are made or use in the us it said the rest includ some that had alreadi been fix as well as those held back for nation secur reason one former white hous offici note that the nsa did not say when the disclosur were made ad that it would be a reason assumpt to conclud that much of that 91 cover flaw the nsa had alreadi use to gather intellig befor alert the compani he also said the figur includ those bought from outsid entiti nsa and nsc offici declin to address those assert it is anyon guess how long the averag gap is between offens use and defens disclosur said denell dixon thayer chief legal and busi offic of firefox browser maker the mozilla foundat the bigger that gap is the greater the likelihood that other countri or hacker use similar hunt techniqu have also discov it even if they havent the target of a us cyber attack can detect what techniqu was use and repurpos it against the us and other if it disclos after it alreadi been execut against that a realli import question dixon thayer said in the revamp us evalu process anoth former offici said that the depart of homeland secur is often the most vigor dove in the discuss argu for disclosur befor other find the same flaw and exploit it a current offici administr offici said that the proport of serious flaw disclos to vendor did not jump after the nsc took control of the process it still earli but the trend has not signific chang the offici said the grow discuss about us polici on vulner disclosur come as hous and senat leader prepar to fine tune three relat bill on cybersecur inform share which are design to give compani legal protect for report attack to the govern mozilla and mani other technolog compani oppos those bill becaus they will give the govern more inform about custom and attack without requir the govern to give more inform to the compani dixon thayer said offici could even take what they learn about new techniqu from the industri to launch their own attack instead of help defend report by joseph menn in
