2015-11-06  11 06 that is a question microsoft is tri to answer cash rich profit and sport new leadership the compani want to chang it imag in silicon valleylong ensconc in the pacif northwest the compani has boost it focus on the bay areaevid abound but perhap most notabl has been a recent shift by the compani to hold regular event in san francisco someth someth show up is half the war or someth like that microsoft has a new chief of deal make push the changepeggi johnson whose formal titl is execut vice presid of busi developmenti task with partner buy and general cut a swath through the startup scenejohnson previous work for qualcomm where she oversaw qualcomm lab microsoft of cours has it own research crew to figur out how microsoft approach deal in this frothi period i snag johnson for an interview what follow is aneditedvers of our convers you can thank me for cut out joke that i thought were funni at the time butdid not convert at all to the written word execut vice presid of what job titl are vagu on a good day and complet opaqu the rest i ask johnson what her job actual entail i am in charg of our strateg partnership im also involvedin our engag with the vc communiti were realli tri to deepen those relationship ispend a ton of time down in the valley i like to think satya nadella microsoft ceo has given me the freedom to maketh valley our new best friend im down there all the time im also involv in our mampaact here and so as we look at startup we look at various invest im on ourinvest council and just basic while do sort of our day to day biz dev that goesacross all of the group im also look at new growth area for the companyso it all about how do we attain those and i person feel that partnership are a huge part ofthat it definit an element of innov with the focus on partnership i note follow her commentsthat the set of prioriti she outlin seem broad someth that she agre to given her abil to make deal of all sort it is worth ask doe microsoft want to partner invest or buy partner invest or buy you will have notic that microsoft foray into startup invest while exist over the past few year have fallen away in quantiti that and it isnt unfair to say that the softwar shop has had less of an interest in larg scale ventur capit work than say googlealphabet which has a power ventur barnacleattach to it hull this has long confus me the best answer that i receiv on the question befor was from a microsoft execut who said that given the scale of the firm balanc sheet ventureact simpli wasnt accret to have such problem i ask johnson whi microsoft appear to have a greater focus on partner instead of buyingsh respond by stress how the compani approach partnershipsi dont summarizein ani pejor sens it a decent encapsul of the compani past effort later in our chat we return to similar water and johnson explain how an acquisit can come into exist even through prior partnership you know whether it acquisit or partnership or commercialagr i think youll see us just step up on that becaus for sure we know we cant you cant build or buy everyth right  so we believ it can accelerateour ambit by look into innov new partnership were defin partnership weredefinit much more collabor and we have more open api  i think our acompli acquisit was an interest one which start with a partnership andlook at their mobil e mail app on io and android and what i would like to highlight withthat one is the speed that we actual turn that around and brought it out the door it appear that microsoft take is that partner is a good first step and one that can be follow up with other sort of transact if they are warrant this can go well the acompli deal is an exampl of that or it can not the nokia deal was a partnership and financi relationship that becam a purchas that becam a dumpster fire of investor capit scale matter johnson is not constrain by deal size i ask if she was focus more on deal in the million of dollar or if microsoft was still open to deal in the billion we look at everyth i would say and you know wehav the balanc sheet for that which againg us some amount of freedom as we look at compani but there no again prescribedmethod there so scale of purchas is open end to that point it is fair to say that price of privat technolog compani are not cheapmicrosoft has to pay at least market rate for compani if you have money as microsoft and other tech giant do it is hard to negoti a discount i was curious if johnson found current valuat a bit much for her tast you know we have a valuat process and if it make sens to us weproce it realli i would say whether we decid to acquir a partner is less about the moneyand more about what kind of make sens and in the case of acompli it made more sens toacquir we look at what they had and we said we want that we want that and soacquisit made more sens clear with uber it was a partnership relationship salesforc isa partnership relationship there were area that we could build valu that exist that we justhad to leverag and with both of those compani we sat down and figur out sort of the near term and the longer term one and we had such a i guess a good experi with both as i saidit led to even more integr in other area around the product line so it realli go to be on a case by case basi if you were an entrepreneur hope for a magic key to unlock a bushel of microsoft dollar that answer probabl doesnt meet your hope i can howev offer some encourag i ask johnson about acqui hire as a potenti method to pick up talent the transact variet has becom a normal tool in the marissa mayer yahoo era is microsoft open to buy thing for the peopl insid if it makessens were go to do it we are just open to use acquisit just for the talent peopl wese in that were open toit for some interest technolog so there no preset or prescribednot and that the way ive engag with my team and ive just got this first class set offolk on my team who have wonder experi and ive kind of let them loos and said this iswhat i want to do this is what i want to focus on show me how to do it and no idea is toocrazi may the age of the acqui save never die what microsoft believesit bring to the tabl if your a hot compani at the moment in technolog you have no shortag of opportun to snag cash and like partner it a heat moment in the industri with all that that entail along for the ride given that i ask johnson what she think microsoft bring to the tabl shestress it channel as an import tool certain our channel i mean obvious our enterpris partner liveliter everywher across the globe in uniqu differenti factor that we have and veri long term relationship with this compani from one end of the globe to the other theyr notnew some of them are 30 and even 40 year old we just cross our 40 year old birthday sothat probabl the biggest differenti factor that we have and that reson with a youngstartup who has got a great technolog or a great app or servic and theyr think okay howdo i bring this to the broadest set of consum or enterpris custom we check both thosebox the abov is a decent argument to explain whi the whispersconcern microsoft potenti buy box havenev complet die out despit there be littl to no evid that inform talk are even be consid the satya effect but while microsoft like other larg tech firm has much to offer smaller less matur compani it also retain a linger imag problem i was curious about the impact of microsoft new ceo satya nadella and how his hire may havechang thing i think it made us more relev and there are a coupl of thingssatya is present in the valley often im down there often we have a team base down there weve deepen our relationship with this team weve listen to their feedback you know iftheyv got great advic for us and ill come in and say what more can you do we do have ayoung compani look to make a cloud decis what can we do to make sure were on theirradar and weve incorpor it in fact and i think just be in those convers hasopen door for us this youll note tie back into johnson prior comment about how much time she spend in silicon valley herself i would call it someth close to a pattern but im not suffici english for that sort ofdiminut chat with johnson was a use exercis becaus it help me and i hope you better understand where microsoft is head our convers also throw light and color onto what other tech firm might be up to id say that johnson view microsoft balanc sheet as a weapon but that she isnt hell bent on writingmass check in the short term instead i would anticip a decent spate of nine figur deal and an increas focus on link silicon valley compani to it extant deal that would be someth that might work for everyon
