that impress investor and sent share surg to near 15 year high with a new and better oper system in window 10 a lead posit in game with xbox and a deep entrench within corpor microsoft is unlik to see it fortun sour anytim soon in the near term the instal of more than 110 million copi of window 10 on devic is like to drive revenu for product that are wide incorpor in it such as the bing search engin and upsid tie to strong demand for it various refresh surfac devic and xbox could lead to strong sale throughout the holiday current the dividend yield on microsoft share is 268 but if microsoft can leverag it recent win to boost adopt of cloud base servic such as offic 365 which carri higher margin then microsoft grow cash stockpil could support futur dividend increas and that whi it one of my favorit for dividend investor of ani age dan capling regular dividend stock like the one my peer have suggest here can be smart move for investor of all age but anoth area to consid is real estat real estat invest trust or reit offer substanti yield from the rental and other incom they collect and tax rule requir reit to pay out near all of the incom they earn in the form of dividend payment in particular healthcar reithcpnysehcpi especi relev to those in their 80s with it emphasi on senior hous properti as well as medic offic build hospit skill nurs facil and life scienc laboratori within the past few year hcp has also expand beyond the border of the us with properti in the uk that give investor some diversif geograph given the demograph of the us popul hcp is at the forefront of a trend that will onli acceler in the year to come with strong relationship with properti oper and a conserv but opportunist view toward expans and growth hcp has the attribut that someon in their 80s can appreci with hcps dividend yield approach 6 and a 30 year track record of annual dividend increas it hard for investor to find altern that will give them as much incom with as much secur as the healthcar reit offer att recent acquir directv which creat an excit and uniqu busi opportun for the compani as ceo randal stephenson recent said we now have integr solut that are unlik ani competitor in the market refer to the fact that att has a wider varieti of product to offer than competitor such asverizonsprint ort mobil the integr allow att to offer more bundl servic and also to cross sell more servic to it exist custom which could potenti lead to entic packag deal that could lure custom away from the competit telecom stock are general not too volatil and att is no except the stock has a beta of just 036 which impli that it is onli about 36 as reactiv to market move as the sp 500 in other word if the market crash by 50 att sharehold should get hit with onli an 18 drop the stock has a steadi revenu stream that should get it through ani tough econom condit that come up the directv integr could creat a littl more volatil but att is like to remain a low volatil stock as far as the dividend is concern att pay a bond like 566 dividend yield which it has increas everi singl year for 30 year so not onli doe att pay sharehold an excel incom stream but the incom stream also grow over time at an averag rate of 42 per year over the past two decad an invest in att wont make you rich overnight but a reliabl high pay stock like this with room to grow is a great choic especi for older investor understand preserv of capit is import howev give yourself an opportun to keep up with the rate of inflat so your nest egg doesnt lose it true valu is import too that whi id
