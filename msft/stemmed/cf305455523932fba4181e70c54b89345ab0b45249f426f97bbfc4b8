us govern to identifi gap in secur in fact no one spot him that night in 2014 and he was abl to penetr the facil result in the fire of asoldi found asleep on the jobth skill set land him just a few month later atcloud comput compani rackspac as itschief secur officerus his stealth and smart toprotect the data of the firm 300000 custom nowhesfac unpreced attack on an entir new battlefront the cloud a recent reportsay 87 percent of organ are make use of cloud infrastructur while research firm idc is predict cloud infrastructur spend will rise to more than33 billionin 2015 account for a third of all inform technolog spendinga evidenc by the dell emc megamerg this week the futur of comput is in the cloud and everyon know it especi the hacker accord to alert logic cloud secur report 2015cyberattack against cloud system increas by as much as 45 percent in 2014 while attack against on premis infrastructur remain flatwith the huge rise in cloud adopt togeth with the ever decreas cost of deploy applic and servic in the cloud amazon alon has drop the price of it amazon web servic offer near 50 time sinc 2006 hacker now have a much larger surfac to probe for access to sensit data hacker have begun to increas target cloud comput infrastructur as more compani util those system alert logic turn the tide to take on hack group thatar well resourc and high sophist kelli reli on his militari train to turn the tide in favor of the good guy he describeshi effort to secur rackspac network as defend the homeland and has organ the compani in a militari fashion follow the principl of uniti of command which kelli said can be transfer directlyfrom the physic battlefield to cyberspac when an attack take place within a compani it need to be veri clear who the incid command is and all the other execut have to understand that they have to stand down and trust that the incid command is go to lead them through this incid this is a theori kelli tri to get his custom to adopt but it is also someth he implement rigor atrackspac he will take the rein if a secur breach is deem a tier two attack but if a tier one attack is detect which could do serious reput or financi damag kelli know he has to step asid and let chief oper offic mark roenigk takecharg with such unpreced level of cyberattack take place against cloud infrastructurekelli said hes regularlyask if cloud storag of datai safer i dont think it a black and white answer but i think with the except of those small percentag of compani that can invest and do all the thing they can do cloud is a better betkelli admittedh has a slight bias consid his current posit brian kelli say for most compani store data in the cloud is the best bet rackspac uneven handshak when kelli join rackspac a year ago he saw a major issu with the way cloud compani dealt with custom he saw a situat where cloud provid took littl to no respons for protect the data onc the custom had sign up for their servic a relationship he dub the uneven handshak and someth he was not comfort with it is time that we even out the handshak that cloud provid do more kelli said given our access given our scale given the depth of resourc we have there is a lot more we can do at his first meet with the board of director of rackspac he was equal blunt tell them he wont be abl to prevent attack from take place but he could work to make detect the attack much better to do this kelli onc again look to his militari pastin the 1980s the us govern creat three cybersquadron offens defens andresearchhunt and when it came to fill out his oper secur team kelli interview the origin three command of these squadronsa they had oper experi and oper disciplin and hire two of them kelli is bring some of that militari oper disciplin to rackspac carri out multiplehunt mission within the compani to make sure attack dont comefromwithin a wast of time and money from his custom point of view the challeng is to provid adequ secur to compani who simpli dont have the resourc to protect themselv against the scale and sophisticationof attack we see today the type of busi you oper will determin the level of cyber attack you see against your compani alert logic to date these smaller compani have been left to fend for themselv and as kelli see it they are wast their time they get some quasi secur technolog guy and he goe out pick a hand of product plug them in and we know that with the natur of the threat today it is complet useless a wast of time and money anyon who is target them is go to be in without ani issu at all while take more respons and use rackspac securityresourcesmay reduc the risk signific for it custom it is not go to deter the more sophist and well resourc hacker group from continu to attack the cloud inform share to address that the industri need to make a chang and kelli is lead the charg to make sure this happen by onc again look to his past the originalinform share and analysi centerswer establish to help share inform on cyberthreat to critic infrastructur but askelli knew from his involv their success was limit due to the slow pace of inform sharinghowev the militari veteran knewth potenti to make a real differ if they manag to make effici inform share a realiti with kelli lead the charg the cloud secur allianc csa which count among it membership all the main player in the cloud comput world has establish an inform share platform to allow compani to share data anonym about breach to prevent hacker from use the same method to attack one compani after anoth i think secur profession understand the valu of inform share unfortun as an industri we havent been veri success of that kelli said the new system known as cloud cyber inform share center is host at rackspac and is just get up and run but kelli said he hope it will disrupt the oper of the group he see attack his custom data everyday the key discrimin is that we are tri to exchang inform at a veri tactic level and we are tri to exchang that inform in a matter of minut if not hour if i see an attack tonight i will have my oper team character that attack in as much detail as possibl and get that on the wire as quick as possibl and into the hand of microsoft and googl and amazon and dropbox drive up the cost us presid barack obama address a joint news confer with chines presid xi jinp in the rose garden at the white hous in washington sept 25 2015 the us has press china to rein in cyberattack reutersgari cameron in recent week there hasbeen the high profil visit of chines presid xi jinp to the us and declar by presid barack obama that sanction would be impos on ani chines compani found to be steal intellectu properti from us compani sinc the deal was struck between jinp and obama thechines govern last week arrest five hacker at the behest of the us for kelli it all about drive up the cost of be a hacker and by use this approach the industri has been success at squeez out the small player and nonprofession while this mean fewer group attack it also mean more room for the big guy to attack group includ organ crime and nation state by share inform in a fast and effect manner kelli and the csa are hope to drive up the cost of attack the cloud for these group too particular when it come to the use of expens tool known as zero day which are previous unknown vulner in softwar and which are sold for a lot of money on the dark web if i see a zero day of cours i am go to have to deal with it at the time but as quick as human possibl i am go to get that out to my peer with the hope that the rest of the cloud provid are go to know about it and when the hacker tri and go to one of them it is not go to work now we have driven up their cost the cat and mous game of cyberattack versus cybersecur is a constant evolv environ and just as hacker have adapt from target pcs to target smartphon they are now look to the cloud as the next big target compani need to know exact what their respons are but just as importanti the need for cloud provid to meet them halfway
