2015-10-16 Steve Ballmer has been keeping busy over a year since he stepped down from Microsofts board of directors. One hand is occupied with owning the Los Angeles Clippers, the other -- a 4 percent stake in Twitter. And there was no better a place for him to reveal that latter fact but on the social network itself. Good job @twitter,@twittermoments innovation, @jack Ceo, leaner, more focused. Glad I bought 4% past few months. Like @alwaleedbinT move too 	&mdash; Steve Ballmer (@Steven_Ballmer) October 16, 2015 When the tweet was initially discovered, there were some questions as to the veracity of the tweet, since it wasnt from Ballmers verified account, ClipperSteveb. He later issued a Tweet from his old account, redirecting Twitter users to his new handle, Steven_Ballmer. In addition, Ballmer confirmed the legitimacy of the Tweet via an email to Bloomberg. @clippersteveb Can you confirm that you Tweet on Twitter Stake is Legitimate? There are questions out there all due respect to you. 	&mdash; Bullltalk (@Bullltalk) October 16, 2015 After reports of the tweet began trickling out Friday, Twitter stock jumped 3.13 percent to 30.64, as of 1:31 p.m. EDT. Ballmer adds to the number of high-profile owners of Twitter, such as Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alaweed bin Talal, who owns over 5 percent of the social network, according to Reuters. Twitter co-founder Evan Williams owns a 6.8 percent stake, and CEO Jack Dorsey also owns over3 percent of the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
