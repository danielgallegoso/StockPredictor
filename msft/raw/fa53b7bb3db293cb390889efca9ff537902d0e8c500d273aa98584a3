2015-11-04 LONDON, November 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --  '#colouryoursummer', a campaign by UM Sydney for Coca-Cola South Pacific, has won the US$5,000 Grand Prix of the Warc Prize for Connection Strategy. The Prize, in its inaugural year, showcases the best examples of channel thinking that deliver brand advantage. Entries were judged by a panel of senior marketers and agency-side strategy experts, chaired by Aaron Fetters, SVP Marketing Solutions, comScore. A total of 20 entries were shortlisted for the global competition and 13 emerged with medals, as the judges awarded four Golds, five Silvers and four Bronzes. There were also five Special Awards for Commercial Impact, Attribution, Context, Paid Owned Earned strategy and the best low-budget campaign, each with USD$1,000 prize money. The full list of winners can be viewed on the Prize website, http://www.warc.com/connectionprize, where Warc subscribers can also read the shortlisted papers. The winning campaign featured smaller 250ml Coke cans that were made available in a limited-edition range of colours that teenagers could collect and share. The strategy put Coca-Cola's owned assets (its cans) at the heart of the campaign and through a connected system of touchpoints gave teens the opportunity to unlock the cans to discover a colourful world of content, experiences and prizes. The campaign led to an increase in sales 27% above forecast." Leo Roberts, GMM Integrated Marketing Communications, Coca-Cola South Pacific highlighted how the #colouryoursummer campaign exemplified many of the principles that underpin Coca-Cola's approach to communications planning, and credited UM's execution. "#colouryoursummer is a campaign we're very proud of. The strong link from insight and strategy to execution, the importance of owned media, the fact that it is inherently participative, the integrated nature of the overall plan and the manner in which it encourages consumers to discover more and more elements are all fundamentals of what we believe makes for great marketing communications in the modern age." Sophie Price, Chief Strategy Officer, UM Australia said "Winning the Grand Prix is a real honour for both UM Australia and Coca-Cola South Pacific, especially as this is the first year of this global competition." Price also noted the importance of collaboration, and acknowledged the role of partner agencies Ogilvy Sydney andSatellite Media. Aaron Fetters, the chair of the judging panel and svp/Marketing Solutions at comScore, praised the campaign's "integration of touchpoints and channels". "This submission and the underlying campaign masterfully demonstrated structured objectives and tangible goals, and followed through by delivering real results," he added.
