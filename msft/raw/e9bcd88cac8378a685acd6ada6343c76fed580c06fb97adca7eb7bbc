2015-11-12 Anupdate for Xbox One that began rolling out Thursday brings support for Xbox 360 games to the platform. Only a smattering of titles are supported at launch, but the initial 104 games will be sure to satisfy at least some gamers. The older console, which first launched in November 2005, has more than 1,100 games available, so there's still a big gap between full compatibility and the initial rollout. In this first list, hit titles like "Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts," "Fable II," "Fallout 3" and "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas" have made the cut alongside arcade titles like "Zuma," "A Kingdom for Keflings" and "Lumines Live." However, there are no "Call of Duty" games supported at launch, and the only "Halo" game on the list is downloadable title, "Spartan Assault." This may be less of a concern for Halo fans, however, as "Halo: The Master Chief Collection" already brought most of the older Halo titles to the Xbox One last year. The four main Halo titles came on the disc, while "Halo 3: ODST" was later made available as a download. This will be little consolation to those who would rather not buy the same game twice, however.  Microsoft is promising regular updates that will expand the list. All three Bioshock titles are planned for future updates, as well as "Call of Duty: Black Ops," "Halo: Reach" and "Halo Wars." The company is also inviting gamers to vote on which games should be included in a later update via a dedicated website.
