2015-10-22 Today Microsoft reportedthe financial performance it recorded during the first quarter of its fiscal 2016. Microsoft generated $0.67in adjusted per-share profit off non-GAAP revenue of $21.66 billion in the three-month period.    Analysts had expected the Redmond-based software shop to earn an adjusted $0.59 per share, on revenue of $21.03 billion. Microsoft also reported GAAP revenue of $2.04 billion. By either metric, Microsoft shrunk compared to its year-ago first fiscal quarter in which it brought in $23.2 billion in total top line.    Update: I spoke with Microsoft about its non-GAAP revenue metric. In short, it's a way for the company to demonstrate Windows revenue akin to how it did in the past, despite new accounting methods. Expect to see this as a recurring stat every quarter from here on out.    Second Update: Microsoft laid off 1,000 workers or so, quietly. News is out, however. Appears that the cuts were not constrained to a single group or location. The cuts are less than 1 percent of the company's total staff. Still, it's a lot of people.    Up around a point in regular trading, Microsoft is up sharply inafter-hours trading following its earnings beat.    This earnings report marks a change for the company, which now disseminates its financial data under a new internal structure. The company now has 3.5 main business segments (Via a Microsoft slide deck that can be found here.):     Productivity and Business Processes (PBP), which contains commercial Office revenue, consumer Office revenue, and Dynamics.   Intelligent Cloud (IC), which contains service revenue and 'Enterprise Services.'   More Personal Computing (MPC), which contains Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search.   Corporate and Other, which contains everything else, and larger corporate functions.    Make sense? Let's see how each did:     PBP: $6.3 billion in revenue. Down 3 percent, year-over-year. Using constant currency, revenue from this group rose 4 percent comparatively.   IC: $5.9 billion in revenue. Up 8 percent, year-over-year. Using constant currency, revenue from this group grew 14 percent.   MPC: $9.4 billion in revenue. Down 17 percent, year-over-year. Using constant currency, revenue from this group fell 13 percent.    So, Microsoft's growth divisions managed a mixed bag of expansion, while, as I think was expected, the Windows group took it in the shorts.    The company announced that its commercial cloud business is now on an $8.2 billion annual run rate. Office 365 consumer picked up 3 million new subscribers. Surface brought in $672 million in top line, down from its year-ago score of $908 million. Microsoft recently introduced new Surface hardware.      Raw Numbers      In the quarter, Microsoft recorded GAAP operating income of $5.8 billion, and non-GAAP operating income of $7.1 billion. The company's GAAP operating income fell 1 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.    Microsoft net income on a GAAP basis totaled $4.54 billion, inching up to $5.44 when usingadjusted metrics. Compared to its year-ago quarter, Microsoft's GAAP profit rose by 2 percent.    The company stressed the impact that shifting currency markets had on its performance, continuing a trend that we have seen from a number of companies that have multinational operations. Here's the damage:        Forex headwinds are to business, of course, as the weather is to your local economist.  A Broader Look  There is a lot to parse in the report, which is more technical than usual due to the inclusion of various non-GAAP metrics, difficult comparative alleys, and, of course, anew structure. As such, I presume that today's earnings call will be lively.    That said, Microsoft managed to land its numbers, and see its share price dramatically rise. Things can't be too bad.
