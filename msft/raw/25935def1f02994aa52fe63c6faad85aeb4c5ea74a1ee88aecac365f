2015-10-27 NEW YORK, October 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- - Cross reference: Picture is available at AP Images (http://www.apimages.com) and http://www.presseportal.de/nr/113002/ - ThyssenKrupp Elevator launches MAX, a game-changing predictive and pre-emptive service solution that extends remote monitoring capabilities to dramatically increase current availability levels of existing and new elevators. Leveraging the power of Microsoft Azure Internet of Things (IoT) technology, MAX makes it possible for an elevator to "tell" service technicians its real needs, including real-time identification of repairs, component replacements, and proactive system maintenance.  (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151023/279986 ) Today's twelve million elevators worldwide move one billion people each day, making the elevator the most used means of transport - and also the safest - but in one year of operation these elevators are unavailable due to service interventions in a cumulative amount of over 190 million hours; MAX is set to improve all these statistics, aiming to cut unavailability periods by half. Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of ThyssenKrupp Elevator: "Our mission is to do something nobody else in our field has done before: To transform a century-old industry that has relied on established technology until now. Cities need innovations that respond to the challenges of the massive urbanization we are currently witnessing. We are very pleased to work with Microsoft to truly take ThyssenKrupp into the digital era and change the way the elevator industry offers maintenance services." With MAX, data collected in real time from connected ThyssenKrupp elevators is sent to Microsoft's trusted Azure cloud platform, where an algorithm calculates the remaining lifetime of key systems in each elevator. Now, ThyssenKrupp's team of over 20,000 service technicians will be able to rely on MAX as their wingman, making it possible to be informed in advance when components will need to be repaired or replaced. In a MAX-connected building, people will wait less time, resulting in decreased stress and more quality time.
