2015-11-02 Preview members are getting another update for the New Xbox One Experience. Notably, this only brings improvements in stability and fixes for some issues. But it shows that the update is gearing up for its final and official public release onNov. 12. Some of the issues that will be targeted by the update include sudden turning off of console, blank appearance of games and apps, crashing apps, malfunctioning party chat, failure of games and apps to launch and crashing guide. The full details of the fixes are featured over at DualShockers. There are also a few issues that Microsoft is currently working on in the latest update, including issues with apps, the Edge browser and wireless network. New games and Xbox One features aside, Microsoft has also introduced a new program that could benefit long-time players. Over at the Xbox Wire, the company has detailed how it plans on rewarding players who have been on the Xbox platform for a while. There are a total of 60,000 rewards credits that can be obtained on the Xbox Live Rewards. Simply ordering new titles on the Xbox One can easily reward up to 25,000 credits. So far, five titles have anywhere between 3,000 to 6,000 rewards credits. These are Rare Replay, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, Forza Motorsport 6, Halo 5: Guardians and Rise of the Tomb Raider. Buying all five titles alone will immediately reward another set of 35,000 rewards credits, pushing it up to 60,000 credits or $60 convertible money. This can then be used to buy games, DLCs, movies or shows via the Microsoft account. The only catch is that the games should have been purchased after Oct. 27. Those who bought the games before that, specifically anywhere between June 26 and Oct. 27 this year, will still get retroactive credit. All five titles bought during that time period will still get 35,000 bonus rewards credits.  New Xbox One Experience trailer(Credit: YouTube/Xbox)
