2015-10-13 NEW YORK, Oct. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Organizations must continuously strive to innovate in order to attract sought-after attendees at every type of gathering. BizBash, the leading news source and marketplace for event professionals and marketers, has unveiled its annual Most Innovative Meetings list, featuring 15 of the most powerful conferences, expos, trade shows, and summits. Organizations like C2 Montreal, Mashable, Microsoft, and Adobe have crafted meaningful experiences, including conducting business on a Ferris wheel and kicking off events with a Guinness Book of World Records attempt, that provide value and relevance for attendees, exhibitors, sponsors, and stakeholders alike.  "Every year we're impressed by the ingenuity of the meeting industry. Organizers continue to stretch the boundaries of what a conference or trade show means today, proving that serious, content-driven events don't have to follow a tried-and-true formula," says Anna Sekula, BizBash editor in chief. "And the conversations on social media generated by these innovative live experiences provide lasting global reach and serve as millions of personal testimonials as to why people must attend year after year."
