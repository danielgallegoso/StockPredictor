2015-11-09 LAS VEGAS, Nov. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --EPISERVER ASCEND 2015 -- Episerver, a leading provider of digital content, digital marketing and digital commerce solutions, today introduced the Fall 2015 release of the Episerver Digital Experience Cloud. Offering substantive new and converged functionality from the best of Ektron and Episerver, the Fall Release empowers marketers, merchandizers and digital developers to instantly realize their brilliant ideas through a super productive "people-first technology" platform. Key to the Fall '15 Release is the product convergence promised by Episerver in January of this year, which has already seen popular Ektron concepts such as the Digital Experience Hub (DXH) and eSync Content Staging and Review come together with Episerver capabilities such as Digital Commerce and the Find search relevance engine in the Spring '15 release.  Fall '15 convergence addresses easier creation and deployment of more sophisticated forms, Instant Templates, and comprehensive project management tools to improve collaboration while streamlining content development. Net new capabilities such as optimization of commerce campaigns, a new Microsoft SharePoint and Office 365 connector, commerce implementation reference architecture, and proven tools to streamline the move from earlier releases round out the benefits for both new and existing Episerver customers.  "We're working to diminish the difference between the creative concepts our users have and their ability to execute them," said James Norwood, Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice President of Strategy for Episerver. "Too many vendors spend too much time talking about features and functions, often forgetting the people these things were intended to benefit. At Episerver, we never will. We believe technology should empower people: people who develop, people who create, and people who communicate. Our promise is that technology, when done right, should make you feel like you have super powers. Quite simply, Episerver gives you the tools to make your work easy, effective and rewarding; no special suits or helmets required." Quick FormsFall '15 gives digital practitioners a new forms engine and forms builder with a simplified user experience that offers a rapid and ultra-flexible way to build forms via drag and drop functionality. Marketers can now support process automation and progressive profiling efforts with the ability to customize the presentation, conditional formatting, and even pre-populate and personalize forms with data from other marketing automation platforms  through the Episerver DXH  all without the need for IT/developer intervention.  Instant TemplatesDesigned to support inspiring and ultra-productive digital development, the Instant Templates capability  based on the popular "Page Builder" and "Master Templates" functionality of Ektron  empowers content editors to create their own re-usable templates from within edit mode. Users can now leverage a library of reusable components (i.e. blog entries, news items, videos, etc.) to create content once, and use it in multiple ways  across multiple sites, audiences and channels  all while ensuring brand consistency.  Commerce CampaignsAddressing the need for both greater agility and performance in digital marketing efforts, the new digital commerce campaign functionality enables marketers to organize commerce activities into campaigns and assign unique business rules, easily define discounting and promotion logic, and apply key performance indicators (KPIs) to each, in support of agile marketing activities and campaign optimization.  Content Staging and Review New Projects functionality provides comprehensive team collaboration and project management tools to coordinate, streamline and, most importantly, better manage content development activities across the organization, and even around the globe. More than a content staging platform, it offer marketers and merchandizers much needed visibility into all content projects in progress, along with the ability to comment and collaborate with colleagues, assign workflow, track revisions, and preview and publish content. Microsoft SharePoint and Office 365Fall '15 includes a brand new SharePoint connector, which makes it easy to access and work with SharePoint content libraries from within the Digital Experience Cloud via a simple drag and drop approach, and offers broad support for the latest Microsoft release including SharePoint 2013, SharePoint Foundation 2013, and Microsoft Office 365.  Commerce Quick StartAlso featured in the Fall '15 release is the new "Quicksilver" commerce best practice reference implementation framework, which allows organizations of any size to get up and running on the digital commerce capabilities of the Episerver Digital Experience Cloud quickly. Quicksilver makes it easy to get started with a robust reference architecture that includes shopping cart, check out, search and indexing pre-configuration  significantly reducing time to value.
