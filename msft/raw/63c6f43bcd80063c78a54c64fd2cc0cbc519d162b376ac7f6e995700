2015-11-06 Apples new stylus dubbed Pencil and the bigger 2-in-1 tablet iPad Pro are gearing up for release. Even though, the demand for tablets has not been note-worthyin the past couple of years, a recent survey saysApple fans are excited to try the iPad Pro. The Apple iPad Pro release date has been set for Nov. 11. The new tablet is an ambitious device for Apple as it features a humongous 12.9-inch display, unlike the other iPads released thus far. The concept of 2-in-1 tablets was made prominent by Microsofts Surface Pro lineup of devices. Notably, Microsoft recently released the power-packed Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10 on board. Meanwhile, with just five days to go, the famous coupon and deals app Retale apparently surveyed 500+ Apple device usersto understand how the iPad Pro will be received. The survey results picked up by Phone Arena said that75 percent of the participants are reportedly waiting for the tablets release. Surprisingly, a good 68 percent of the survey participants are excited to try the Apple Pencil. This result is quite stunning because of the fact that Steve Jobs infamously wrote off the idea of stylus in Apple products. About 87 percent of the same group of survey takers reportedly said they would like to try Apple products prior to purchasing them. A good 59 percent of those would like to buy the iPad Pro from the store than placing an order online. Moving on to the Apple iPad Pro pricing, the device will set the buyers back by $799 for the 32 GB Wi-Fi only variant. The 128 GB Wi-Fi only model, on the other hand, will cost $949. The LTE version with 128 GB native storage will be made available for $1,079. Lastly, curious buyers that would like to get their hands on the Apple Pencil will have to shell out $99, while the Smart Keyboard can be purchased for $169.
