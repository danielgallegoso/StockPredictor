2015-11-04 BURLINGTON, Mass., Nov. 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Attunity, Ltd.(NASDAQ CM: ATTU), a leading provider of big data management software solutions, today reported its unaudited financial results for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. "The record revenue we reported for the quarter was driven by scaling our direct sales force, expanding our big data solutions for enterprise and cloud environments anddelivering on effective marketing and business development programs. Each of these factors is continually feeding a pipeline of customer orders that are becoming larger in scope and value, and across a wider base of new customers than ever before," said Shimon Alon, Chairman and CEO of Attunity. "We are experiencing strong activity and increasing interest from customers, partners and other vendors across all of our product offerings, geographies and business lines. As we further extend our portfolio of innovative Big Data management solutions, we are able to support a larger number of different environments, such as data warehouses, clouds, Hadoop, open source, and others." Recent Operational Highlights: Financial Highlights for Q3 2015, compared with Q3 2014:  "Our strong partnerships with the major Big Data vendors have resulted in an extension of the OEM agreements we have with Microsoft and another leading global provider of business software and hardware systems. These agreements enable us to continue to generate leads and revenue, enhancing our brand. Working closely together with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure teams, we are becoming a critical enabler of database migration services that facilitate data transfers between on-premises and cloud environments," continued Mr. Alon. Big Data Management and Cloud Solutions Attunity enhanced its replication platform for the cloud "CloudBeam," with the launch of a version for Microsoft Azure, as well as an expanded portfolio for AWS Cloud with support for Hadoop. The Company has already closed the first CloudBeam solution order for the Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse and is building a growing pipeline working jointly with the Microsoft cloud team. Attunity Visibility has become a trusted solution for enterprises, optimizing performance and balancing workloads from traditional data warehouses to Hadoop. Now, as enterprises look to adopt Hadoop at scale, they need to prioritize investments and make more informed decisions to optimize the value to business users. To accommodate this growing market need, Attunity enhanced Visibility with the launch of "Attunity Visibility 7.0" in order to enable data usage analytics in large Hadoop clusters. With these capabilities, Attunity Visibility is the market's only Big Data Management solution offering users business insights on the utilization of both Hadoop and data warehouses.  Sales and Marketing The Company continued to expand its sales, marketing and business development teams, having grown the total headcount nearly 40% compared with the same period in 2014. These investments in sales and marketing, along with an expanded presence in the Big Data space at events and with analysts, have resulted in steady new customer acquisition and a strong sales pipeline. More importantly, we believe they will enable us to position the Company for sustainable long-term growth through the remainder of the year. "By working closely with the AWS and Microsoft Azure teams, we are now widely recognized as a keystone for database migration services that facilitate data transfers between on-premises and cloud environments. The strong partnership with the major Big Data vendors resulted in extending the OEM agreements we have with Microsoft and another leading global provider of business software and hardware systems," concluded Mr. Alon.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Attunity uses Non-GAAP measures of net income, operating income, operating profit margin and net income per share, which are adjustments from results based on GAAP to exclude expenses and amortization associated with the acquisitions, net of related tax, stock-based compensation expenses in accordance with ASC 718, acquisition-related compensation expense and non-cash financial expenses such as the effect of a revaluation of liabilities presented at fair value and accretion of payment obligations. Attunity's management believes the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release is useful to investors' understanding and assessment of Attunity's on-going core operations and prospects for the future. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating its business internally and as such has determined that it is important to provide this information to investors. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.For further details, see the Reconciliation of Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information table later in this press release. Safe Harbor Statement This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the anticipated features and benefits of Replicate Solutions, within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other Federal Securities laws. Statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words "believes", "expects", "anticipates", "intends", "estimates", "plans", and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "will", "should", "would", "may" and "could" are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. For example, when we say that investments in sales and marketing will enable to position the Company for sustainable long-term growth through the remainder of the year, we use a forward-looking statement. Because such statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties and actual results, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, could differ materially from Attunity's current expectations. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: risks and uncertainties relating to our history of operating losses and ability to achieve profitability; our reliance on strategic relationships with our distributors, OEM, VAR and "go-to-market" and other business partners, and on our other significant customers; risks and uncertainties relating to acquisitions, including costs and difficulties related to integration of acquired businesses; our ability to expand our business into the SAP market and the success of our Gold Client offering; timely availability and customer acceptance of Attunity's new and existing products, including Attunity Maestro and Attunity Visibility; risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, which may not necessarily be indicative of future periods; changes in the competitive landscape, including new competitors or the impact of competitive pricing and products; a shift in demand for products such as Attunity's products; the impact on revenues of economic and political uncertainties and weaknesses in various regions of the world, including the commencement or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism as well as cyber-attacks; and other factors and risks on which Attunity may have little or no control. This list is intended to identify only certain of the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting Attunity, reference is made to Attunity's latest Annual Report on Form 20-F which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the other risk factors discussed from time to time by Attunity in reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Except as otherwise required by law, Attunity undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  2015 Attunity Ltd.
