2015-11-11 Microsofts latest Lumia 950, Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550 come bundled with Windows 10 Mobile out of the box. However, many old Lumia device owners with Microsoft Lumia and Nokia Lumia brand names are eagerly waiting to receive the Windows 10 Mobile on their smartphones. A recent leak meanwhile shows the list of old Lumia handsets that are earmarked to receive the latest Windows OS. The Lumia devices with Windows Phone 8.1 on board were initially rumored to receive the Windows 10 Mobile update in December. However, the latest leak comes from Orange Poland, which is a major carrier in that country. The carrier has apparently set out a plan to update the Lumia handsets in two phases. According to the leak, the first set of update will be rolled out from Dec. 14 onwards. This phase will apparently include the following devices: Lumia 630, Lumia 635, Lumia 640, Lumia 735 and Lumia 830. The second phase, on the other hand, will be rolled out in 2016 i.e. Feb. 1. The handsets that come under the second phase ambit include Lumia 520, Lumia 532, Lumia 625, Lumia 720, Lumia 820, Lumia 920, Lumia 925, Lumia 930, Lumia 1020 and Lumia 1320. In case, Lumia 1520 owners are shocked to see their handset being not part the two phases, the reason is Poland-specific. As it turns out, the Lumia 1520 was sold in Poland unlocked (SIM-free). Therefore, carrier Orange Poland does not have the responsibility of updating it, GSM Arena reported. This means, the much-appreciated Lumia 1520 will also get the Windows 10 Mobile update at some point across the globe. Readers should, however, note thatthis is not the exhaustive list of Lumia handsets set to receive Windows 10 Mobile. This list only shows the handsets scheduled to receive the update under the specific carrier. However, Orange Poland may not be selling all the Lumia handsets released thus far. Hence, there is still hope for those very old Lumia handsets which are not part of the aforementioned list.
