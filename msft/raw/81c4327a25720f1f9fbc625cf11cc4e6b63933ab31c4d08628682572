2015-10-23 LONDON -- Microsoft's efforts to gain some traction in the smartphone market is set to continue with leaked images of what is thought to be the company's mid-range Windows 10 device, theLumia 650. Joining the premium Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL which were launched earlier this month, the new smartphone, which is code-named Saana, was leaked to Windows news website Winbeta. That leaked image was joined by one from renowned leaker Evan Blass, who posted an image of the rear of the smartphone -- showing a device which looks remarkably similar to the LG Nexus 5X which was launched by Google recently.

 Details about the hardware are limited at the moment, but from the leaked image, we can seen that the new smartphone will very likely be called the Lumia 650, based on the time shown on the homescreen, something Microsoft typically does for all its smartphones. Microsoft is currently strugglingto make a serious impact on the smartphone market globally, where iOS and Android dominate. Windows Phone -- the precursor to Windows 10 Mobile -- currently has less than 3 percent market share with most analysts not expecting that to grow significantly any time soon. The Lumia 650 could replace the company's Lumia 640 smartphone, though that was only released in April of this year, featuring a 5-inch HD screen, 8GB of storage and an 8 megapixel camera on the rear.
