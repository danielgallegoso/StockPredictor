2015-11-09 LONDON, November 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Overly, the first hydration drink made with all natural ingredients, is today launching into Planet Organic across London and on Amazon.co.uk. Created by school friends Will Hammersley and Chris Hannaway (26), Overly is proven to keep you hydrated with less fluid, is low in calories and contains no added sugar. Sports hydration drinks have been long in decline in the UK, with recent Kantar Worldpanel data giving a 10.2% value/8% volume decline YoY, with drinkers migrating to bottled and tap water. Further Mintel research shows that 50% of consumers describe sports drinks as "unhealthy" (Mintel 2014), suggesting that consumers are looking for lower calorie and "cleaner" options. Will says, "we couldn't find a sports drink that wasn't artificial, ineffective or too sweet, so we took to the kitchen to make our own. It took hundreds of variations, with each one (usually) a little better than the last. Finally, we landed on a product that we are totally proud of - a totally delicious blend of spring water, juices, agave and electrolytes, and no refined sugar." Electrolytes are lost when you sweat and are important for staying hydrated - as well as preventing cramp and maintaining water balance. Overly's electrolytes come from the "Great Salt Lake" in Utah, USA and have been scientifically proven to reduce the volume of fluid needed to hydrate by over 40%*, which has many benefits for athletes. "Finally it's time that we weren't ashamed of drinking sports drinks. For too long they have looked, tasted and performed like window cleaner - it's about time someone cleaned them up and every sports player something to feel great about", adds Chris. Overly is available in Orange & Mango or Blueberry and is priced at 1.99 per 500ml bottle from Planet Organic stores across London or available on Amazon.co.uk.  *Fire Fighter Hydration Clinical Study, University of Montana 2008 Sources: Mintel Sports & Energy drinks 2014.
