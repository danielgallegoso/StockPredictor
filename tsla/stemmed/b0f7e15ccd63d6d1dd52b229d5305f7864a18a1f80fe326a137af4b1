2015-11-04  11 04 dublin just as data is transport around the globe at superfast speed the folk behind one of the startup build ahyperloop believ that cargo and peopl also will soon seamless zip across the face of the planet cover distanc as great as 10000 kilomet 6214 mile faster than commerci jet newli appoint hyperloop technolog ceo rob lloyd was join by compani co founder brogan bambrogan andshervin pishevar at the web summit in dublin wednesday to detail the firm plan for the next four year and how by 2020 the econom andenvironment advantag of this so call fifth mode of transport origin propos by elon musk founder of spacex and tesla motor inc will be immedi obvious to everyon two year ago musk produc a wide public white paper that call for the build of a hyperloop a superfast vessel that run insid a vacuum seal tube or as bambrogan hyperloop tech chief technolog offic and a former spacex engin put it we build a tube full scale that is go to be point to point so if you can imagin two citi are your destin that you want to connect to physic build a larg tube between those two locat and you control the environ within that tube bambrogan said hyperloop tech is alreadi build a lot of hardwar with the aim of get a work prototyp up and run befor the end of 2016thatprototyp will featur a 3 meter diamet tube that will extend to more than 3 kilomet which will have pod travel through it at over 700 mph that is just the start point lloyd who recent join the compani from cisco system inc said the next step is to pick threeproject from around the world to demonstr the power of the transform natur of hyperloop these three project will be built and oper by 2020 and the firm is alreadi get request from multipl govern with a lot of interest in europ the middl east and asia as well as a coupl of opportun in the us 10000 kilomet lloyd said the hyperloop concept will work over a wide rang of distanc from 40 km to 10000 km and thathyperloop tech is investig one project call for a 9300 km track pishevar indic he has high hope about what thisnew technolog could achievewith a network like that with a grid that is built around the world you can truli move good and packag and peopl like packet of data and rout them so effici to put that distanc in context it would allow you travel from the eastern tip of russia to the other side of europ with some room to spare meanwhil the longest nonstop commerci flight has clock in at a littl more than 13800 km while most of the focus on hyperloop has center on replac plane and train the most truli revolutionari aspect of the new system could be it role in the movement of cargo pishevar contend the15 biggest cargo ship globallypollut the world more than all the car on the planetad that the high energi effici hyperloop technolog could have a huge impact on the environ as well as the econom of move cargo around the world pishevar said the launch of the prototyp by the end of 2016 is the project kitti hawk moment a refer to the north carolina town wherethewright brothersmad the first poweredairplaneflight get to the kitti hawk moment is absolut critic he saidthat is a tip point where mani govern both region and nation will look at that as a proof point a comput render show the hyperloop in motion jumpstartfund the plan the hyperloop tech chairman spoke about includ the propos 70 billioncalifornia high speed rail link that inspir musk to come up with the idea there ispowerpoint and then there is steel hyperloop technolog has rais a lot of money and is back by sherpa ventur the ventur capit fund ofear uber investorpishevar it is seen as a credibl and legitim face of the hyperloop revolut but iti not the onli compani look to build on musk idea thesimilar name hyperloop transport technologyhtt is also plan to build a version of hyperloop but it is take a much differ approach to develop this revolutionari technolog head by german entrepreneur dirk ahlborn htt is look to build hyperloop with a crowdfund and open sourc approach that will seeengin scientist and develop around the world collabor in return for stock option rather than salarieswhen intern busi time ask lloyd opinion of the competit the former cisco execut was prettydismiss of what ahlborn and htt are do i think the construct of an open sourc crowdfund idea is interest but we are talk about hundr of million and then billion of dollar of capit that will be build critic infrastructur that a countri will reli on lloyd said he then ad i dont believ build hyperloop can be done in an open sourc communiti that cant build anyth there is powerpoint and then there is steel and our compani is buy steel and build technolog today and i think that is what is go to allow us prove this concept within the next year howev one point on which the two compani almost agre is that build a hyperloop infrastructur outsid the us is much more like than construct one insid the us although lloyd said hyperloop technolog is still open to the possibl if we can find a right of way and a support regim state governor citi we would love to see an infrastructur demonstr our capabl in the unit state outsid the unit state we see a differ view as to the valu of public infrastructur and there are project such as high speed rail project go on around the world that are actual stop to paus and say should we look at hyperloop
