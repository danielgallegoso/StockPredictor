2015-10-24  10 24 downgrad consum report this week withdrew it recommend of tesla model s say that it data now show that the acclaim electr luxuri sedan is too unreli to recommend imag sourc tesla motor share oftesla motorsnasdaqtsla took a nosed this week after a downgrad from a surpris sourceconsum report the vener consum advoc has long been one of tesla biggest fan it call the model s the best car it had ever test give the automak a huge import stamp of approv at a key moment in the compani life but this past week it downgrad the model s the magazin review still love the car but it now has enough data to assess the model s reliabl and it not good enough for the car to maintain it recommend status that news took a big bite out of tesla share price as you can see tsla price data by ychart but what doe the news realli mean for tesla three auto mind fool offer their view below john rosevearher what we have learn it realli hard to build a car to global standard of reliabl and perform at a profit it no surpris that tesla might not be there yet it has done well to get this far but i think and i have been say this for sever year now that mani tesla investor underestim both the incumb automak and the challeng involv in manufactur car manufactur is the real moat of the auto busi consum report did a lot to make the model s a credibl entri in it earli day but i dont think this downgrad will have the same kind of impact at least in the near term it unlik to make a big dent in tesla sale of the model s most buyer who can afford a vehicl at the price point of the model s and now model x have the resourc to have someth els to drive if the silicon valley hot rod let them down and i think it still true that most tesla buyer are earli adopt type will to put up with some glitch in order to get the latest technolog tesla still strong custom satisfact rate bear that out but it one thing to sell a six figur car that isnt as reliabl as atoyotaferrari salesdont seem to suffer from reliabl concernsit anoth thing entir when your tri to compet direct with toyota or withbmw nasdaqothbamxf the problem is that that where tesla is go more to the point it what tesla still sky high valuat hing on the proposit that the compani will be abl to enter the automot mass market with it upcom model 3 and generat sale in the hundr of thousand or more per year it no secret that tesla is aim the model 3 at the territori occupi by compact luxuri sport sedan like bmws vaunt 3 seri the 3 seri isnt yet a batteri electr car but other big automak likegener motorsandvolkswagenar expect to have credibl batteri electr competitor on the market by the time the model 3 arriv or soon after gm and vw know how to manufactur a reliabl car electr or otherwis at an afford price and still make a profit if it want to be more than a nich player tesla will have to be abl to do the same right now for all of it robot and big claim and high tech sheen it not clear that it can that doesnt seem to troubl most tesla investor but it should travi hoiumconsum report singl hand crush tesla motor stock on tuesday but doe it realli mean anyth to the compani long term the answer is yes but it may not be in the way you assum short term i dont think tesla will feel ani backlash from a poor reliabl rate from consum report there are too mani fanboy of tesla to cancel model s or model x order en mass especi in the small quantiti theyr go to be produc at in the next few year what the report bring up is how incred hard it is to build a reliabl car and how difficult it is to do it in a time cost effect manner the model x for exampl is alreadi about two year behind schedul and may be set itself up for reliabl issu of it own those falcon wing door realli cool but if they were easi to mass produc someon would have done it by now for tesla motor oper this may be a sign that develop expens could be higher than expect warranti cost could be on the rise and consum skeptic could be come just as tesla is tri to hit the mass market the true challeng will be seen when the model 3 is releas sometim in the next two to five year tesla has indic that it will sell the model 3 start for about 35000 a price that would compet with mani convent vehicl today and will be make them by the hundr of thousand but if tesla cant make a 100000 car that doesnt have squeak rattl and leak as consum report is state how can we expect tesla to make hundr of thousand of model 3s for a low price and high qualiti and if the averag consum walk in with a skeptic eye to begin with it could lead to disappoint mass adopt of the model 3 investor shouldnt jump ship just becaus consum report gave tesla a bad rate but it should highlight the risk the compani face in becom a global automak make car is hard and tesla may not be as far ahead of it global competitor as elon musk and wall street would have you think in fact tesla motor hasnt yet proven that it a high qualiti manufactur at all and that should worri ani sharehold daniel millerhow quick thing chang consum report flip flop on tesla model s reliabl faster than you could flip your pillow to the cool side while i think consum report remov tesla model s from it recommend list is a big deal part of me realli want to play devil advoc there certain a case to be made in that regard for instanc the most common complaint though there were some more serious one was overal squeak and rattl annoy driver of the model s howev as one person note to consum report the car is so veri silent when drive that minor squeak and rattl that you wouldnt be abl to hear in a gasolin engin car becom veri annoy if your will to pay 70000 for a fulli electr vehicl that in some trim can beat high end sport car in a quarter mile race and your largest complaint is nois becaus the car ride is so quiet without a combust engin i think youll be satisfi with your purchas overal that sentiment seem to be felt among tesla model s consum albeit with consum most be earli adopt and more strong pro tesla at this point despit the problem our data show that tesla owner satisfact is still veri high nineti seven percent of owner said they would definit buy their car again said consum report while tesla has essenti brush off the the downgrad a larg amount of uncertainti remain the truth is we dont fulli know how well these model s vehicl hold up over time the model s went into product in 2012 and in the histor time frame of the automot industri the vehicl is just bare due for a midcycl refresh sure it a concern that reliabl issu are begin to pop up with the model s but at this point it not a big deal becaus tesla custom servic is second to none earli adopt are will to deal with the small issu and the automak could fix reliabl issu befor it vehicl go mainstream and ultim peopl still want to buy tesla model s regardless of the downgrad the biggest problem here is that investor are so easili spook the next billion dollar isecret the world biggest tech compani forgot to show you someth at it recent event but a few wall street analyst and the fool didnt miss a beat there a small compani that power their brand new gadget and the come
