2015-11-01  11 01 lithium ion batteri have been around for near a quarter centuri find their way from laptop to electr car but british scientist say the popular energi storag devicecould be obsolet by the end of the next decad replac by a differ recip involv oxygen research at the univers of cambridgeannounc theyv creat a batteri prototyp thatovercom some of the challeng to make the technolog commerci viabl includ size and amount of energi lithium oxygen also known as lithium air batteri can discharg the new batteri has thepotenti to store up to 10 time the amount of energi held in heavier lithium ion cell of compar size the inventorssay the implic are enough to make ani tech aficionadoch mobil phone could be charg onc a week instead of everi few hour and electr car could final travel distanc similar to gasolin burn car without the annoy of frequent half hour recharg the concept batteri still easili a decad away from a market readi prototyp would be a fifth of the weight and cost of current lithium ion batteri what weve achiev is a signific advanc for this technolog and suggest whole new area for research we havent solv all the problem inher to this chemistri but our result do show rout forward toward a practic devic professor clare grey of cambridg depart of chemistrysaid in the announc of her team find the result were publish in the oct30 edit of the journal scienc part of the univers of cambridg laboratori demonstr model of a lithium oxygen batteri is shown in this handout pictur by tao liu releas oct 29 2015 reuterstao liuhandout via reuter tao liuhandout via reuter the batteri prototyp reli on graphen a lattic of carbon atom that has the potenti to radic chang the way object are made if the cost of make it can be cut the team use a differ chemistri fromprevi lithium oxygen studi and found it to be more effici the oxygen base energi storag has the potenti albeit possibl 20 year down the road to sidelin the lithium ion batteri use in everyday gadget lithium ion batteri have a high power to weight ratio and have becom the standard for electr car japanes electron compani panason has been the largest manufactur of lithium ion batteri for year and is the primari supplier to tesla motor which use thousand of panason 18650 batteri cell in each of itscar batteri pack last week tesla sign a deal to buy similar batteri from lg chem the korean technolog compani that is among the largest supplier of energi storagefor electr and hybrid electr vehicl japan automot energi suppli corpor produc the lithium ion pack for the nissan leaf the world bestsel electr car
